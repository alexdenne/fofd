# How UK suburbanites find local green spaces—and how Friends groups can shape discovery

**Farthing Downs already has strong visibility on walking apps but remains invisible on London tourism platforms, creating a significant untapped opportunity.** With over 1,200 AllTrails reviews yet only 9 TripAdvisor reviews and no Visit London listing, the Friends group can dramatically increase website traffic by closing specific platform gaps and leveraging a free Komoot Partner Profile—the single highest-ROI opportunity identified. The genuine tension between promotion and preservation is manageable: UK sites like Dockey Wood bluebells and Richmond Park have developed effective dispersal and off-peak strategies that avoid the viral overwhelm seen at Lake District TikTok hotspots.

## How people actually discover green spaces

No UK survey directly measures what percentage of green space visits originate from Google Search versus Google Maps versus word of mouth—Natural England's People and Nature Survey tracks visit frequency and destinations but not discovery channels. However, proxy data reveals the dominant role of organic search: **68% of AllTrails' 18 million monthly visitors arrive via organic search**, with 79% of those using non-branded queries like "hikes near me" rather than searching for AllTrails directly.

For suburban London green spaces, the discovery funnel typically works in layers. Initial inspiration often comes from social media or word of mouth, but route planning happens on dedicated walking apps. AllTrails dominates casual discovery with **60-65 million global users**, while Komoot's **45 million registered users** skew toward European cyclists and more serious hikers. In the UK specifically, OS Maps holds unique value for navigation accuracy (ranking 4th among UK navigation apps) but lacks the community discovery features of its competitors. The merged Outdooractive/ViewRanger platform serves approximately 7.3 million users and maintains partnerships with 600+ organisations including national parks.

**Search volume for local terms remains modest but targeted.** While exact figures require paid SEO tools, searches like "walks near Coulsdon" and "nature reserves South London" likely generate 100-1,000 monthly queries each—small numbers, but highly intentional visitors worth capturing. These long-tail keywords represent people actively planning visits rather than casually browsing.

## Google Maps presence: what Friends groups can and cannot control

The most important finding for community groups: **you cannot claim a Google Business Profile for land you don't manage**. Google's eligibility guidelines explicitly require business owners or authorised representatives to verify listings. For Farthing Downs, only the City of London Corporation (the managing authority) can claim the official Business Profile.

However, Friends groups have substantial influence through alternative channels. The **Google Local Guides program** allows anyone with a Google account to contribute photos, reviews, answers to questions, and suggestions for corrections. The Friends of Perivale Park successfully used this approach—adding multiple points of interest to Google Maps, all reviewed and accepted by Google, without needing landowner authorisation. Their contributions consistently generate Google notifications like "Your photo is making a difference" as they gain traction.

**For Farthing Downs specifically**, the Google Knowledge Panel draws information from Wikipedia, Wikidata, the City of London website, and user-contributed content. Anyone can suggest edits through the Feedback link, though only verified representatives can claim the panel. The Friends group could significantly improve visibility by:

- Encouraging members to leave detailed, keyword-rich Google reviews mentioning features like "chalk grassland," "wildflowers," and "Bronze Age barrows"
- Contributing high-quality photos through Local Guides (these appear in search results and knowledge panels)
- Creating or improving the Wikipedia article (which feeds directly into Google's Knowledge Graph)
- Adding sub-locations as points of interest (car park, Millennium Cairn, Happy Valley viewpoint)

**Google reviews directly impact local search visibility.** Review signals account for 9-15% of local pack ranking factors according to Moz research. More reviews with recent dates, 4+ star ratings, and keyword mentions increase the likelihood of appearing in "parks near me" searches. Currently, Farthing Downs has only 9 TripAdvisor reviews—generating more Google reviews should be a priority.

## Walking apps: Komoot's free Partner Profile is the standout opportunity

The research uncovered a critical opportunity: **Komoot offers completely free Partner Profiles specifically for associations and community groups**. UK organisations already using this include the British Mountaineering Council, Cycling UK, and Blaze Trails (with 80+ regional groups). A Partner Profile provides:

- A dedicated profile page for Friends of Farthing Downs
- Ability to create unlimited routes organised into themed Collections (e.g., "Heritage Walk," "Wildlife Trail")
- Content appearing in the local Discover feed for nearby Komoot users
- Free Komoot Academy training to become a certified "Community Expert"
- Crucially, the ability to embed routes on the Friends website and link externally

This is the **only major walking platform offering direct website linking for community groups at no cost**. AllTrails allows route descriptions to mention websites (not hyperlinked), but Komoot Partner Profiles enable proper integration between the app and the Friends group's web presence.

**Farthing Downs already has presence on these platforms**, but the content could be enhanced:

| Platform | Current Status | Opportunity |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| AllTrails | 934 reviews on main route, 3 routes total | Add detailed waypoints for interpretive stops, enhance descriptions |
| Komoot | Multiple routes listed | Apply for Partner Profile, create Highlights for key features |
| OS Maps | Standard mapping coverage | Limited discovery potential; focus elsewhere |
| Outdooractive | Routes available | Good POI system, but smaller UK audience |

**Komoot's "Highlights" feature** enables marking specific locations with photos and tips—perfect for Bronze Age barrows, WWII trenches, and orchid meadows. These Highlights appear to all Komoot users planning routes in the area, even if they don't specifically search for Farthing Downs.

## Current online presence reveals significant gaps

A comprehensive audit shows strong positioning on walking apps but weak coverage on mainstream tourism and discovery platforms:

**Strengths:**
- City of London Corporation website provides excellent, detailed pages including visitor information, heritage content, and a downloadable 10-year management plan
- AllTrails presence is excellent with 1,200+ combined reviews across three routes
- Visit Surrey listing exists with comprehensive description
- Friends of Farthing Downs website is active with events, history, and wildlife information

**Critical gaps:**
- **Visit London**: Not listed, despite being managed by City of London Corporation and located within Greater London
- **Time Out London**: No articles or listings
- **TripAdvisor**: Only 9 reviews, most from 2012-2019
- **Social media**: Facebook group exists but limited discoverability

The Visit London gap is particularly notable. London & Partners (which operates visitlondon.com) focuses on commercial tourism partners, and free green spaces appear systematically under-represented. However, proactive outreach and positioning as part of the South London Downs National Nature Reserve narrative may create opportunities for inclusion in curated walking content.

## Local media landscape offers accessible coverage opportunities

**Inside Croydon emerges as the highest-value local outlet** for green space coverage. This independent publication has:

- A dedicated "Outside Croydon: Walks" section
- A regular walking columnist, "WANDLE WANDERER" (Ken Towl), who writes about local rambles
- "Nature Notes" by Moira O'Donnell covering wildlife stories
- Existing tagged coverage of Friends of Farthing Downs and City Commons
- Free advertising offered to community groups for paid subscribers

The **Croydon Ramblers** (800+ members, founded 1950) already run weekly Thursday walks at Farthing Downs—a partnership opportunity hiding in plain sight. The **"The Only Way Is Coulsdon" Facebook group** has 9,000+ members and represents the largest local community platform. Several South London nature bloggers cover Surrey Hills walks with GPX downloads and could be approached for Farthing Downs features.

**What makes green spaces newsworthy for local media:**
- Awards and recognition (Green Flag status renewals, NNR anniversaries)
- Wildlife stories (skylark breeding, rare wildflower sightings)
- Heritage angles (Saxon field systems, archaeology discoveries)
- Policy changes (parking charges generated significant coverage in 2021)
- Seasonal features (spring orchids, autumn colours)

## The promotion-preservation tension is real but manageable

UK examples of green spaces overwhelmed by social media attention provide cautionary lessons. **Dockey Wood at Ashridge Estate** (Hertfordshire) receives 1.7 million annual visitors to the broader estate, with bluebell season creating intense pressure on a three-week window. Documented consequences include:

- Historic woodbank damage from overflow parking
- Trampling that damages bluebell bulbs (5-7 year recovery time)
- Progressive path widening destroying wildflower habitats
- Tree root exposure from erosion

The **Lake District** now has over 100,000 TikTok posts and "faces the highest risk of environmental degradation and overcrowding" according to TOG24 research. Richmond Park's 5.5 million annual visitors generated **42 tonnes of litter in June 2020**—seven times the June 2019 figure—when viral social media combined with pandemic restrictions.

**However, Farthing Downs faces lower risk than these examples.** Current visitor reviews consistently describe it as "not very busy" offering "peace and quiet." The car park is described as "limited" and "can be busy at weekends," but no evidence suggests the site approaches capacity. The genuine constraint is parking, which naturally limits peak visitor numbers—a feature, not a bug, for conservation purposes.

**Successful UK mitigation strategies include:**

- **Off-peak promotion**: Ashridge advises visiting "early in the morning or late in the afternoon" and actively redirects visitors to alternative bluebell locations within the estate
- **Dispersal within sites**: Creating waymarked routes that spread visitors across different areas rather than concentrating them at the most photographed spots
- **Peak charging**: Dockey Wood charges £3.50 adult entry during specific bluebell weekends only, using fees to fund conservation staff presence
- **Designated photo spots**: Concentrating Instagram-friendly areas to reduce trampling elsewhere
- **"Tread Lightly" messaging**: Friends of Richmond Park's David Attenborough-narrated film has been viewed 500,000+ times, framing protection as invitation rather than restriction

## Friends of Richmond Park: the model to emulate

With 3,700 members and ~300 volunteers contributing 15,000 hours annually (worth £160,000+ at London Living Wage), Friends of Richmond Park demonstrates what's achievable. Their success elements:

- **Adopt-an-Area litter scheme** with ~200 volunteers covering 29 areas
- **Visitor Centre** staffed by 60 volunteers, open 364 days, serving 55,000+ annual visitors
- **"Tread Lightly" campaign** featuring Sir David Attenborough and Clare Balding
- **Professional digital presence**: website with online membership, shop, YouTube channel with educational content
- **Park Life magazine** published tri-annually

Their messaging approach works: leading with connection ("Please love it like I do"), explaining consequences with specific facts ("takes 5 years to recover"), and using trusted voices. This framing avoids the counterproductive "Keep Out" tone that alienates potential allies.

## Five priority actions to increase website traffic by 500%

Based on highest ROI activities feasible for a volunteer-run group, these recommendations prioritise quick wins that create compounding visibility:

### 1. Apply for a free Komoot Partner Profile (Week 1)

**Why highest priority:** This is the only free platform offering community groups the ability to link directly to an external website from walking routes. Email partner@komoot.de requesting a Partner Profile for Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley. Reference other UK users (British Mountaineering Council, Cycling UK) as precedent.

**Immediate actions:**
- Create 3-4 themed Collections: "Farthing Downs Heritage Trail," "Happy Valley Wildlife Walk," "Easy Family Loop"
- Add Highlights for key features (Bronze Age barrows, WWII trenches, orchid meadows, viewpoints)
- Complete free Komoot Academy training
- Embed routes on Friends website, driving bidirectional traffic

**Expected impact:** Routes appear in Discover feed for all 45M Komoot users searching the South London/Surrey area. Each Collection links to website, creating sustained referral traffic.

### 2. Launch a Google review campaign among members and partners (Month 1)

**Why high ROI:** Google reviews directly influence "parks near me" and "walks near Coulsdon" search rankings. Currently, the site has minimal Google review presence while excelling on AllTrails (1,200+ reviews)—rebalancing this gap captures different search intent.

**Immediate actions:**
- Create QR codes linking to Google Maps listing for car park signage and events
- Email members requesting detailed reviews mentioning specific features (chalk grassland, wildflowers, city views)
- Ask review writers to upload photos
- Target 50+ reviews in first two months

**Expected impact:** Improved ranking in local Google searches; reviews with keywords trigger "place topics" that match user queries.

### 3. Pitch a feature to Inside Croydon's "WANDLE WANDERER" column (Month 1)

**Why quick win:** Ken Towl writes regular walking features for Inside Croydon, which already covers environmental stories extensively. A detailed walk guide with seasonal highlights and historical narrative fits their established format.

**Immediate actions:**
- Email inside.croydon@btinternet.com with a story pitch
- Offer exclusive content: the celebrity-narrated audio trail, recent wildlife sightings, archaeological story
- Propose a "best kept secret" angle contrasting proximity to London with low visitor awareness
- Request community group free advertising placement

**Expected impact:** Inside Croydon readership includes exactly the local outdoor enthusiasts most likely to become regular visitors and members.

### 4. Request inclusion on Visit London and update TripAdvisor (Month 2)

**Why important gap:** Visit London's absence is notable for a City of London Corporation-managed site. While visitlondon.com focuses on commercial partners, curated walking content and "free things to do" features occasionally include parks.

**Immediate actions:**
- Contact London & Partners through partnership enquiry form requesting inclusion in walking/nature categories
- Position the pitch around South London Downs National Nature Reserve designation (2019)—a genuine hook
- On TripAdvisor, recruit 25+ members to leave recent reviews, including photos
- Ensure accurate, complete information on both Happy Valley and Farthing Downs listings

**Expected impact:** Visit London listing would deliver highest-volume organic discovery; refreshed TripAdvisor reviews signal an active, worthwhile destination.

### 5. Partner with Croydon Ramblers for co-promoted events (Month 2-3)

**Why leverage existing infrastructure:** Croydon Ramblers already run weekly Thursday Farthing Downs walks. This is **800+ members regularly visiting the site without integrated promotion** of the Friends group.

**Immediate actions:**
- Propose joint branding on existing Thursday walks
- Create "Friends of Farthing Downs sponsored route" for Ramblers programme
- Cross-list events on both websites
- Collaborate on seasonal special walks (wildflower ID in May, archaeological tour, photography morning)

**Expected impact:** Immediate access to 800+ engaged walkers; joint events create local media hooks; establishes the Friends group as the definitive authority on Farthing Downs.

## Managing the promotion-preservation balance

For Farthing Downs specifically, **overcrowding risk appears low given current visitor patterns**, but proactive messaging positions the Friends group as responsible stewards:

- Promote off-peak visiting in all communications ("Best visited early morning for skylark song")
- Create dispersal content directing visitors to Happy Valley when Farthing Downs car park is full
- Develop "Tread Lightly at the Downs" messaging explaining chalk grassland fragility
- Use seasonal hooks (orchid season, autumn fungus walks) to distribute visits throughout the year
- Include dog-on-lead requests for ground-nesting bird protection in all route descriptions

The **500% website traffic target is achievable** through these five actions because they address currently empty channels (Komoot Partner, Visit London, refreshed TripAdvisor) while converting existing visitors (AllTrails users, Ramblers walkers) into Friends website visitors. The Komoot Partner Profile alone could generate sustained referral traffic at zero cost, while the Google review campaign captures high-intent local searchers who currently never encounter the Friends group website.
