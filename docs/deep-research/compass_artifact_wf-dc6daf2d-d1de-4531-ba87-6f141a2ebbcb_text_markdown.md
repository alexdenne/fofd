# The Complete 2025 Guide to Affordable, Maintainable Websites for UK Community Groups

**For groups with limited budgets and volunteers aged 50-80+, the ideal technology stack combines Google Sites (free) or Wix with charity discount (£57/year), GoCardless for membership subscriptions (0.75% + 20p per transaction), and CAF Donate for Gift Aid-compliant donations (free Gift Aid processing).** This combination keeps ongoing costs under £150/year while remaining manageable for non-technical committee members. The critical success factor isn't the platform—it's ensuring at least three people can update the website and access all credentials.

This report provides specific 2025 UK pricing, real community group examples, and a complete technology stack recommendation for "FoFD&HV" (likely a "Friends of" community group following UK naming conventions) that meets all stated requirements.

## Platform pricing reveals clear winners for budget-conscious groups

The website platform landscape for UK community groups has consolidated around three practical options: free platforms with limitations, paid platforms with charity discounts, and specialist parish council providers. Each serves different needs.

### Wix delivers best value with charity discount

Wix offers a **70% discount for UK registered charities** through TechSoup or Charity Digital Exchange, making it the most affordable full-featured option. Without discount, Wix Core costs **£16/month + VAT (£230/year)** for payment capabilities. With the charity discount applied to a 2-year subscription, costs drop to approximately **£57-115/year**.

The minimum plan for accepting donations is **Wix Core**, which includes Wix Payments integration charging **2.1% + £0.20 per transaction** for UK cards. PayPal and Stripe also integrate, with Stripe offering lower rates for nonprofits (**1.2% + £0.20**). Critically, Wix charges no additional transaction fees on top of processor fees.

For elderly users, Wix presents a moderate challenge. The drag-and-drop editor allows elements to be placed anywhere, which provides flexibility but increases the risk of accidentally misaligning content. **Expect 4-8 hours for basic competency** and 2-4 weeks for comfortable editing. The interface changes frequently (major updates every 6-12 months), which can confuse users who've memorised specific button locations.

When the site creator leaves, Wix allows full ownership transfer to another Wix account holder. Adding a **Co-Owner role immediately upon setup** prevents lockout scenarios—this should be a non-negotiable step.

### Squarespace suits design-conscious groups with higher budgets

Squarespace costs more but offers a more constrained editing experience that prevents design errors. The **Core plan costs £17/month + VAT (approximately £245/year)** for payment capabilities, but carries a **3% transaction fee** on top of processor fees. Eliminating this surcharge requires upgrading to Commerce Basic at **£331/year**.

Squarespace only offers approximately 10% nonprofit discount through TechSoup—far less generous than Wix's 70%. However, its **grid-based editor** is significantly easier for non-technical users aged 70+. The structured system prevents accidentally breaking the design, and templates maintain professional appearance even with limited customisation. **Expect 2-4 hours for basic competency**.

The ownership transfer process mirrors Wix: add administrators via Settings → Permissions, then transfer ownership when needed. **Critical limitation**: if the account holder dies without having added administrators, Squarespace will grant billing permissions to legal representatives but will **not** provide editing access—the site content becomes permanently locked.

### WordPress demands technical commitment or professional support

Self-hosted WordPress offers maximum flexibility but requires ongoing maintenance that's unrealistic for most elderly volunteers. **Security updates must be applied weekly**, plugin updates monthly, and WordPress core updates 2-3 times annually. **61% of hacked WordPress sites were running outdated software**—neglecting updates for six months creates serious security vulnerabilities.

UK hosting costs vary significantly by provider:

| Provider | Monthly Cost | Key Features |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Krystal** | £9.99 (Ruby plan) | B Corp certified, green hosting, no renewal price hikes, 60-day money-back |
| **34SP** | £9.95 | Manchester-based, free hosting for charities available on request |
| **SiteGround** | £1.99 intro → **£13.99 renewal** | London data centre, but significant price jump at renewal |

For Gift Aid-compliant donations, the **Charitable plugin** (£78/year for Basic) or **GiveWP** (£118/year) provides HMRC-compliant declaration collection and export. These require the **WordPress.com Business plan (£240/year)** or self-hosted WordPress.

**Honest assessment for non-technical 70-year-olds**: WordPress is manageable for content updates but not for security maintenance. Budget **£400-600/year for professional maintenance** if choosing this route, bringing total costs to £600-800/year—making simpler platforms more cost-effective.

## Simpler alternatives deserve serious consideration

### Google Sites offers the best value proposition

Google Sites is **completely free** with any Google account, supports custom domains at no additional cost, and integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace for Nonprofits (also free for registered charities). The platform handles multi-page sites, embeds Google Forms for contact and applications, and displays Google Calendar for events.

**Real example**: Hill Rise Allotment Association (hraa.org.uk) runs their entire web presence on Google Sites with PayPal donation buttons embedded—proving the platform handles payment integration adequately for small groups.

For handover, Google Sites excels: add editors via simple email invitation, and transfer ownership through Settings. If using Google Workspace for Nonprofits, an administrator can manage all accounts centrally, eliminating single-point-of-failure risks.

**Limitations**: No custom code, basic templates, limited analytics, and can look somewhat generic. However, for groups prioritising ease of maintenance over design sophistication, these tradeoffs are worthwhile.

### Carrd works for single-page microsites

Carrd Pro Standard costs just **$19/year (approximately £15)** and supports custom domains, Stripe payments, and PayPal integration. However, it's **single-page only**—content-heavy organisations need multi-page capability. Better suited as a supplementary landing page than a primary website for most community groups.

### Notion requires technical intermediaries

While Notion offers clean editing for non-technical users, publishing public websites requires third-party tools like Super.so (£156/year minimum) or Simple.ink (£54/year). Total costs exceed simpler alternatives, and the handover process involves multiple platforms. **Not recommended** for groups prioritising simplicity.

## Payment platform selection depends on transaction type

UK community groups typically need two payment capabilities: recurring membership subscriptions and one-off donations with Gift Aid. Different platforms excel at each.

### GoCardless wins for membership subscriptions

For recurring payments like annual membership fees, **GoCardless with charity discount** offers the lowest fees: **0.75% + £0.20 per transaction** (capped at approximately £3 maximum). A £30 annual membership costs just 43p to process.

Setup requires no monthly fees, and the charity discount is available by updating your business type to "Charity/non-profit" during verification. Direct Debit collection means low failure rates and automatic retries.

**Key limitation**: GoCardless does **not** handle Gift Aid—you must claim separately via HMRC Charities Online using exported transaction data.

### CAF Donate excels for Gift Aid compliance

For donations where Gift Aid matters, **CAF Donate** is the specialist choice. There are no monthly fees, and critically, **Gift Aid processing is completely free**. CAF acts as your HMRC agent, automatically checking eligibility, submitting claims, and paying Gift Aid directly to your account.

Transaction fees are higher than direct processors: **3.6% for card payments** or **2% + £1 for Direct Debit** (capped at £5). For a £20 donation, you'd pay 72p in fees but receive £5 in Gift Aid—a clear net positive.

Over 10,000 UK charities use CAF Donate. The platform handles offline donations (phone/post) and provides branded donation pages with QR code generation.

### PayPal Giving Fund eliminates fees entirely

For registered charities, **PayPal Giving Fund charges 0% fees** and handles Gift Aid automatically. The catch: donations route through PayPal Giving Fund (charity registration 1110538) and are "granted" to your charity within 45-90 days—slower than direct payment.

Worth considering for supplementary donation channels, particularly for donors who already have PayPal accounts.

### Platform comparison for typical community group

| Payment Type | Recommended Platform | Fee on £30 Payment | Gift Aid Handled |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Annual membership | GoCardless | £0.43 | No (claim manually) |
| One-off donation | CAF Donate | £1.08 | Yes (free) |
| Donation (fastest processing) | Stripe | £0.56 | No |
| Donation (zero fees) | PayPal Giving Fund | £0 | Yes |

### QR code payment implementation

For events and printed materials, generate QR codes linking to your donation page. **SumUp with Give A Little** integration offers 1.49% fees for contactless payments with Gift Aid capture. Alternatively, any donation platform (JustGiving, CAF Donate, Donorbox) can generate shareable links that convert easily to QR codes using free generators.

## Real UK community groups demonstrate what works

Research identified successful implementations across parish councils, village halls, allotment associations, and Friends groups—each offering lessons for "FoFD&HV".

### Village halls favour Wix for volunteer-friendliness

**Wye Village Hall** (Kent) uses Wix with Hallmaster booking integration (£2.64/week). Despite using the free Wix tier (visible branding), the site looks professional and handles room booking, event calendars, and venue information effectively. This proves that substantial functionality is achievable without premium subscriptions.

### Allotment associations successfully use Google Sites

**Hill Rise Allotment Association** runs entirely on Google Sites with PayPal buttons for multiple payment amounts plus bank transfer instructions. The site includes committee information, diary dates, news updates, and payment processing—demonstrating that sophisticated functionality doesn't require sophisticated platforms.

### Friends groups typically choose WordPress

**Friends of Victoria Park Stretford** (fovps.org.uk) showcases comprehensive WordPress implementation: donations via Mailchimp subscription, volunteer coordination, community room booking, and extensive governance documentation. Registered as charity 1179731, they demonstrate what's achievable for established groups with technical resources.

**Friends of Richmond Park** (frp.org.uk) manages 3,600 members and 300 volunteers through WordPress with tiered membership systems (£10-15/year). Their patron list (including Sir David Attenborough) reflects the credibility professional web presence can support.

### Parish councils increasingly use specialist providers

Many parish councils choose sector-specific platforms—**Aubergine262**, **NetWise UK**, **HugoFox**—charging £100-300/year with WCAG 2.2 accessibility compliance built in. These handle Transparency Code requirements automatically, making them worthwhile for organisations with statutory obligations.

## Succession planning prevents the most common failure mode

The research reveals that technology choice matters far less than governance practices. Groups fail when one tech-savvy volunteer leaves without documentation—regardless of platform sophistication.

### The minimum viable "bus factor" is three

At least **three people** should be able to:
- Log in and make basic content updates
- Access domain and hosting control panels
- Access the password manager master credentials
- Contact technical support
- Process annual renewals

This redundancy isn't paranoia—it's essential. University computing societies report months-outdated social media and unanswered emails specifically because "no one knows the password."

### Essential documentation for every community group

Create a "Website Bible" containing:

**Technical details**: Platform used, domain registrar, hosting provider, renewal dates (set calendar reminders), SSL certificate expiry, plugins/integrations installed, analytics account access, connected social media accounts.

**Operational guides**: Step-by-step instructions with screenshots for common updates (news posts, event additions, contact changes), backup procedures, emergency contacts for hosting/domain issues.

**Governance policies**: Who can authorise changes, list of current administrators with access levels, policy stating "all digital assets are owned by [Organisation Name], not individuals."

### Password management for volunteer organisations

Never store passwords in plain text documents or emails. Use an organisational password manager—**Bitwarden** (free tier available), **1Password Teams** (50% nonprofit discount), or **TeamPassword** (simple UI ideal for volunteers).

Ensure at least 2-3 trusted people know the master password. Include password manager access in annual trustee induction, and immediately revoke access when volunteers depart.

### Domain registration critical practice

**Always register domains in the organisation's legal name**, not an individual's. Use an organisational email address for admin contact. If a domain is registered to a volunteer who becomes unavailable, recovery requires death certificates, grant of probate, and months of bureaucracy.

## Complete technology stack for "FoFD&HV"

Assuming "FoFD&HV" stands for "Friends of [Location] and [Location] Village"—a typical UK community Friends group—here's the recommended infrastructure meeting all stated requirements.

### Recommended Stack: Under £150/year ongoing

| Component | Recommendation | Annual Cost |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Website platform** | Google Sites (free) or Wix with charity discount | £0 or £57 |
| **Domain** | Register via Namecheap or 123 Reg (.org.uk) | £8-12 |
| **Membership payments** | GoCardless (charity rate) | £0 (transaction fees only) |
| **Donations** | CAF Donate (free Gift Aid processing) | £0 (transaction fees only) |
| **Email** | Google Workspace for Nonprofits | £0 |
| **Password management** | Bitwarden (free tier) | £0 |
| **TOTAL** | | **£65-69/year** |

### Implementation steps

**Week 1: Foundation**
1. Register domain in organisation's legal name (not personal)
2. Set up Google Workspace for Nonprofits via TechSoup verification
3. Create organisational email (info@yourgroup.org.uk) accessible by multiple committee members
4. Set up Bitwarden organisation vault, add 3 administrators

**Week 2: Website**
1. Create Google Sites using organisational Google account
2. Add homepage, about, events, membership, contact, donate pages
3. Connect custom domain (free in Google Sites settings)
4. Add at least 2 additional editors

**Week 3: Payments**
1. Register with CAF Donate (charity registration required)
2. Complete CAF CHV1 form appointing them as HMRC Gift Aid agent
3. Set up GoCardless for membership subscriptions
4. Create donation page with CAF Donate widget and GoCardless membership link

**Week 4: Documentation**
1. Create Website Bible document in shared Google Drive
2. Record video tutorials for common updates using free screen recording
3. Train at least one non-technical committee member
4. Schedule annual digital health check in shared calendar

### For non-registered groups (no charity number)

If "FoFD&HV" isn't a registered charity, Gift Aid isn't available—simplifying the stack:

| Component | Recommendation | Annual Cost |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Website** | Google Sites | £0 |
| **Domain** | .org.uk via Namecheap | £10 |
| **Payments** | SumUp (1.69% card reader, 2.5% links) | £0 |
| **TOTAL** | | **£10/year** |

SumUp provides simple payment links and QR codes without monthly fees—ideal for unregistered community groups collecting membership dues or event payments.

### Five-year obsolescence assessment

**Google Sites**: Google has strong track record of maintaining free services. Even if deprecated, migration paths typically provided.

**GoCardless/CAF Donate**: Established UK financial services infrastructure, unlikely to disappear. Direct Debit mandates portable if needed.

**Wix**: Commercially successful, regularly updated. Lock-in risk exists—content exports possible but design doesn't transfer.

The recommended stack prioritises widely-used, stable platforms with clear handover procedures. No specialist technical knowledge is required for ongoing maintenance.

## Conclusion: Simplicity beats sophistication for longevity

The research reveals a counterintuitive finding: the most successful UK community group websites aren't the most technically sophisticated—they're the most maintainable. Groups using Google Sites with simple PayPal buttons often outlast those with elaborate WordPress installations, simply because any committee member can make updates.

For "FoFD&HV" and similar groups, the optimal approach combines **Google Sites or discounted Wix** for web presence, **GoCardless** for membership subscriptions, and **CAF Donate** for Gift Aid-compliant donations—all costing under £70/year.

The technology choices matter less than three governance practices: ensure at least three people can update everything, document every credential in a shared password manager, and register all assets in the organisation's name. Groups that follow these practices maintain functional web presences for decades. Those that don't find themselves locked out when the "tech person" moves away.

The final recommendation: start simpler than you think necessary. A basic Google Sites page that gets updated is infinitely more valuable than an elaborate WordPress installation that sits neglected because committee members find it intimidating.
