# Preserving community history while keeping websites alive

Community heritage websites face a fundamental tension: honouring the depth of local history while remaining accessible and engaging for new visitors. Research into award-winning UK heritage sites reveals consistent patterns for success—**layer complexity rather than hide it**, create multiple entry points, and treat archives as discovery engines rather than dusty storage. For the Friends of Farthing Downs and Happy Valley, this means restructuring rich archaeological and historical content so it draws visitors in rather than overwhelming them.

## The archive paradox: when depth becomes an asset

The most successful community heritage websites don't bury their historical content—they make it the engine of engagement. **Ryde Social Heritage Group** (rshg.org.uk), winner of the Community Archives and Heritage Group's Best Website Award, features a searchable database of **23,000+ grave records** prominently on every page alongside a "Looking Back" feature showing what happened 50, 100, and 150 years ago. Their approach proves that substantial archives can coexist with accessibility when designed thoughtfully.

MyWarrington.org, which won "Best Community Heritage & Engagement Platform 2025 – North West England," takes an even bolder approach: historical content *is* the main content, organised geographically by district and chronologically through an interactive timeline. The lesson is clear—don't apologise for depth; instead, create navigation systems that make exploration feel like discovery rather than obligation.

Bristol Record Society demonstrates a practical archive retirement model: scholarly publications remain members-only for two years, then move to free access on the Internet Archive. This tiered approach reduces website maintenance burden while ensuring permanent preservation and broader access over time.

## Decision criteria for what to keep versus archive

Successful community heritage sites apply consistent frameworks when determining content placement:

- **Fragility and demand** drive digitisation priority—items at physical risk or frequently requested come first
- **Geographic and topical boundaries** define scope clearly (MyWarrington explicitly covers only areas within current council boundaries)
- **Two-tier access** separates active content from deep archives (members-only recent materials, free older content)
- **Automatic archiving** ensures dated news and features remain findable without cluttering current sections
- **External repository hosting** (Internet Archive) reduces maintenance while ensuring permanence

The Baring Archive Digitisation Selection Model, recommended by The National Archives, prioritises items based on fragility, research value, uniqueness, and copyright clarity. For FoFD, this suggests prioritising unique local materials—the Millennium Cairn documentation, original archaeological surveys, and long-standing member photographs—over general reference materials available elsewhere.

## Information architecture that separates eras without burying them

Three distinct content hierarchy patterns emerge from successful heritage sites:

**Pattern A: Current-first** (British Association for Local History) places news, events, and blog posts on the homepage, with publications and archives accessible through secondary navigation. AGM recordings and e-newsletters appear under "Resources" with a publicly documented retention schedule.

**Pattern B: Blended dynamic** (Ryde Social Heritage Group) mixes current news with historical features on the homepage, using rotating "Looking Back" content to continuously connect past and present. Archives integrate throughout rather than sitting in isolation.

**Pattern C: Gateway architecture** (Herts Memories Network) provides a single search box querying multiple community sites, allowing deep local archives while maintaining clean navigation. This federated model suits areas with multiple heritage groups.

For FoFD's archaeology pages and Millennium Cairn content, Pattern B likely offers the best fit—keeping historical material visible but framed through engaging features that give first-time visitors context and reasons to explore.

## Digitisation that volunteers can actually accomplish

The National Archives emphasises that **digitisation does not replace physical preservation**—digital files require ongoing management and can be lost if not properly maintained. Community groups should start with a pilot collection rather than attempting comprehensive digitisation.

### Technical standards that balance quality with practicality

For volunteer-led groups, these specifications represent achievable standards: **TIFF format at 300-400 ppi** for archival master files of text documents, **400-600 ppi** for photographs with fine detail. Create **JPEG derivatives** for web access. The key principle is lossless formats for masters, compressed formats for delivery.

Dublin Core metadata—the international standard for cultural heritage—simplifies to nine essential fields for community archives: title, creator, date (YYYY-MM-DD format), description, subject keywords, document type, file format, unique identifier, and rights status. A simple spreadsheet with these columns serves as an adequate catalogue for most groups.

### Storage following the 3-2-1 backup rule

Maintain **three copies** of digitised materials across **two different storage types** (local drive plus cloud) with **one copy offsite**. For cloud storage, Backblaze B2 offers professional archival storage at approximately £5-6 per terabyte monthly. The Community Archives and Heritage Group provides free guidance specifically for groups with limited resources through their Digital Preservation for Community Archives PDF at communityarchives.org.uk.

### Funding for digitisation projects

The National Lottery Heritage Fund offers grants from £10,000 to £250,000+ for heritage digitisation, requiring Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licensing for outputs. The National Archives provides smaller grants through its Archive Testbed Fund (up to £5,000) and Networks for Change Fund (up to £15,000). TownsWeb Archiving offers annual grants of £3,000 specifically for community digitisation projects.

## Engaging presentation methods with proven tools

### "On this day" features that connect past and present

The **This Day In History WordPress plugin** (wordpress.org/plugins/this-day-in-history/) allows volunteer groups to enter and manage local historical events, displaying them via widgets or shortcodes. Content sourcing works best from local newspaper archives, library historical collections, and community-submitted memories tied to specific dates. A practical approach: feature one notable event with expanded description plus two to three "also on this day" brief mentions.

### Before/after comparisons that reveal landscape change

**JuxtaposeJS** from Knight Lab (juxtapose.knightlab.com) provides free interactive sliders for then-and-now comparisons, used by major publications including Sports Illustrated and the Boston Globe. The tool creates embeddable code for any website and supports both photographs and GIFs. Critical success factors include precise alignment between images (use Google Slides to overlay with transparency adjustments) and matching dimensions for both photos. Google Street View's timeline feature can capture contemporary angles matching historical photographs.

### Interactive timelines for deep history

**TimelineJS** (timeline.knightlab.com), also from Knight Lab, uses Google Sheets as a database and embeds YouTube, Flickr, Wikipedia, and SoundCloud content automatically. It supports 60+ languages and requires no coding. Best practice: keep timelines under 20 slides for engagement, selecting events that build a narrative arc rather than listing every milestone.

### Oral history that preserves living memory

The **Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)** from the University of Kentucky provides free tools for indexing and synchronising transcripts with audio. For recording, quiet locations with minimal background noise and signed release forms are essential. Modern AI transcription tools like Otter.ai or Descript generate first drafts that volunteers then review and correct—faster than manual transcription while maintaining accuracy.

**HistoryPin** (historypin.org) offers free community-contributed photo archiving, pinning historical images to Google Maps with Street View overlay comparisons. Over 4,000 cultural organisations use the platform, and it particularly suits intergenerational projects connecting schools with care home residents.

## Connecting nature conservation with local history

The National Trust's **Wessex Hillforts and Habitats Project** (nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/dorset/hambledon-hill/the-wessex-hillforts-and-habitats-project) demonstrates exemplary integration of archaeology and ecology. The £114,000 Historic England-funded project manages 13 hillforts across 332 hectares with a unified approach: combined condition monitoring for both archaeology and nature on three-year cycles, "Hillfort Hero" volunteers conducting both archaeological and ecological surveys, and management that balances buried archaeological stratigraphy with nature recovery.

Their key message applies directly to sites like Farthing Downs: these landscapes are "living textbooks, detailing the natural and cultural footprint of our ancestors." The project publishes downloadable guides combining history and nature, rather than treating them as separate disciplines.

### Documenting species change over time

The **Wiltshire & Swindon Biological Records Centre** (and equivalent county records centres across England) maintains approximately two million species records dating back decades, providing historical baselines for understanding ecological change. Their volunteer County Species Recorders serve as local experts who can connect current wildlife observations with historical patterns.

The **Hertfordshire State of Nature Report** (hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/stateofnature) models effective presentation of long-term change, examining 50 years of wildlife transformation and contextualising current status against historical baselines—such as 97% grassland loss since the 1930s.

### Friends groups that successfully blend history with nature

**Friends of Whitcliffe Common** (friendsofwhitcliffecommon.org.uk) gives history equal billing with wildlife, featuring medieval common dating before 1241 prominently alongside walks, wildlife, and geology content. **Friends of St Catherine's Hill** (fsch.org.uk) runs dedicated "History Day" events alongside fungal forays and seasonal walks, demonstrating that heritage programming complements rather than competes with nature activities.

## Making first-time visitors care about local history

Research across successful community heritage sites reveals consistent engagement patterns. Visual content—aerial photographs, commissioned illustrations, interactive maps—makes abstract history tangible. **Know Your Place** (kypwest.org.uk), funded by £379,800 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, allows users to overlay 1880s-1930s OS maps with modern aerial imagery, GPS-enabled for mobile exploration.

The **Open Domesday Project** (opendomesday.org) succeeds by anchoring complex 11th-century data to modern postcodes—visitors search for their town and immediately receive a personalized historical snapshot. This personal connection principle applies to any community site: help visitors find *their* street, *their* family name, *their* remembered landmarks in the archive.

MyWarrington's "I didn't know that about Warrington" quick facts section, Ryde's monthly featured photo, and Bristol Record Society's "Stories from the Archives" all transform dry records into narrative hooks. The pattern is clear: **curate entry points** that reward casual browsing before expecting visitors to dive into detailed archives.

## Recommended architecture for FoFD's redesign

Based on this research, the Friends of Farthing Downs and Happy Valley should consider a **blended dynamic structure** where historical content appears prominently but is framed through engaging features rather than presented as static archive pages.

The homepage should include a rotating "From the Archives" feature—perhaps highlighting the Millennium Cairn project, a historical photograph with before/after slider, or an archaeological discovery with brief narrative. A dedicated "History & Archaeology" section should sit at the same navigation level as wildlife and walks content, not buried in submenus. This section would contain the detailed archaeology pages, Millennium Cairn documentation, and historical documents, but accessed through compelling story-based entry points rather than bare listings.

For AGM reports and governance documents, a separate "About Us" or "Resources" section keeps administrative materials accessible without cluttering the main experience. Older newsletters could move to a searchable archive—potentially hosted on Internet Archive for long-term preservation—with highlights surfaced through the "On This Day" or "From the Archives" features.

The practical implementation path: start with **TimelineJS** to create an interactive history of Farthing Downs from prehistoric archaeology through the Millennium Cairn to present conservation activities. Add **JuxtaposeJS** before/after sliders showing landscape change. Consider an annual "Heritage Day" event following the Friends of St Catherine's Hill model. Connect with Surrey County Archaeological Unit and local biological records centres to contextualise the site's unique position bridging natural and cultural heritage.

## Conclusion

The most effective community heritage websites treat their archives not as obligations to preserve but as assets to deploy. Depth becomes engaging when navigation provides multiple discovery paths—search, browse, map, timeline, featured content—and when historical material connects explicitly to present-day activities and visitor interests. For FoFD, the archaeology pages and Millennium Cairn content represent differentiating assets that few other "Friends of" groups possess; the redesign challenge is not whether to feature this material, but how to frame it so visitors immediately understand why it matters. The research suggests foregrounding stories, enabling personal connections (searchable place names, family connections, "your street in 1900" features), and treating the archive as a discovery engine rather than a reference library.
