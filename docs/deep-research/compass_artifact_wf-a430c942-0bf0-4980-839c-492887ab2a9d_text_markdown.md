# Measuring success for community groups: A practical guide

**For volunteer-run organizations, the key insight is counterintuitive: smaller audiences with deeper engagement outperform large, passive followings.** A 3,900-member Facebook Group is well-positioned for genuine community building—where relationship quality matters more than reach. The challenge isn't growing bigger; it's tracking whether your digital presence drives real-world outcomes like event attendance, volunteer capacity, and community connection.

This guide provides a complete framework for measuring digital success, with a ready-to-use quarterly report card designed for non-technical volunteer committees.

## The metrics that actually matter

Community groups face a fundamental tension between **vanity metrics** (impressive-looking numbers) and **meaningful outcomes** (mission impact). A useful test: "If this number improved by 50%, would our mission definitely advance?" If not, it's probably vanity.

### Website and conversion metrics

**Tier 1 (mission-critical):** Track these monthly
- **Conversion rate**: Percentage of visitors who take action (donate, sign up, register). Nonprofit donation pages average **12-17%** conversion once visitors reach them.
- **Goal completions**: Raw count of email signups, event registrations, donations
- **Traffic sources**: Which channels (Facebook, email, Google) drive visitors who actually act

**Tier 2 (context):** Track quarterly
- Bounce rate (60-70% is average; lower is better)
- Pages per session (aim for 2+)
- Mobile vs desktop split (52-57% of nonprofit traffic is now mobile)

**Key benchmark**: For every 1,000 website visitors, nonprofits typically generate approximately **£1.05** and see about **1.5%** make a donation. Small community groups should track their own baseline first, then aim for gradual improvement.

### Social media: Engagement beats reach

For community organizations, **engagement metrics matter more than follower counts**. A smaller, highly engaged audience is more valuable than a large passive one. Facebook's algorithm now prioritizes Groups over Pages, making your 3,900-member Group a strategic advantage.

**Social media metric hierarchy (ranked by value):**
1. Comments and replies — genuine dialogue
2. Shares — content worth spreading
3. Saves — reference-worthy content
4. Link clicks — intent to act
5. Likes/reactions — lowest value, but easy to track

**Engagement rate formula:** (Total engagements ÷ Total followers) × 100

### The community group funnel

Unlike commercial nonprofits focused on donation conversion, community groups typically move people through this journey:

| Stage | What to Track | Actions to Drive |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Awareness** | Reach, new visitors | Social content, local PR |
| **Interest** | Email signups, follows | Compelling stories, clear calls to action |
| **Involvement** | Event attendance, volunteer signups | Personal outreach, easy first steps |
| **Investment** | Donations, memberships | Impact stories, clear asks |
| **Stewardship** | Retention, advocacy | Thank-yous, regular updates |

Community groups differ from large charities in critical ways: **relationships matter more than automation**, the same person is often donor, volunteer, and event attendee, and volunteer engagement metrics are equally important as fundraising metrics.

## Benchmarks: What "good" looks like

### Facebook Group performance (3,900 members)

Facebook Groups operate very differently from Pages. Your 3,900-member Group is **small-to-medium sized** in community group terms, which typically means higher percentage engagement than larger groups.

| Metric | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Active members | 70-80% | 85%+ |
| Engagement rate | 100%+ | 200%+ |
| Post reach | Variable | Focus on engagement instead |

**Context**: Facebook Page organic reach has collapsed to **1.5-3%** industry-wide, but Groups consistently outperform Pages because members actively choose to join. An 80% activity level is considered "very highly engaged" by Facebook's own standards.

### Email benchmarks

Small nonprofits dramatically outperform larger organisations on email engagement:

| Metric | Large Nonprofit Average | Small Organisation Average |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Open rate | 28% | **46%** |
| Click-through rate | 3.3% | **~10%** |
| List growth (annual) | 3-4% | 3-5% |

**Why small wins**: Smaller, engaged lists have stronger relationships. Small organizations raise less per campaign but **more per contact** (£5 vs £75+ average), indicating deeper supporter connection.

### Website conversion benchmarks

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| Visitor to email signup | 1-3% |
| Visitor to donor | 1-1.5% |
| Donation page conversion | 12-17% |
| Event registration conversion | 5-15% |

### Realistic growth expectations

Environmental and conservation groups ("Friends of" organisations fall here) typically see modest but sustainable growth:

- **Facebook followers**: 0.1-0.5% monthly growth is realistic
- **Email list**: 3-5% annual growth is sustainable
- **Instagram**: 0.6% monthly growth (11% annual)

**Important**: Compare your performance to your own baseline, not industry benchmarks. Year-over-year improvement of **10-20%** is realistic for most metrics.

## Tools for non-technical volunteers

### The minimum viable setup (30 minutes)

1. **Install Google Analytics 4** via Site Kit plugin (WordPress) or platform settings (10 min)
2. **Set data retention to 14 months**: Admin → Data Settings → Data Retention (1 min)
3. **Connect Meta Business Suite** to your Facebook Page (5 min)
4. **Switch Instagram to Professional Account** (3 min)
5. **Create a monthly tracking spreadsheet** (10 min)

### GA4: What to ignore, what to focus on

**Focus on just 4 reports:**
- **Traffic Overview** (Reports → Acquisition → Overview): Where visitors come from
- **Pages and Screens**: Your most-viewed content
- **Realtime**: Check if a social post or email drove traffic
- **User Demographics**: Useful for grant applications

**Set up 3-5 "Key Events"** (conversions) using the thank-you page method:
1. Admin → Events → Create event
2. Set condition: page_location contains "/thank-you" 
3. Toggle "Mark as key event" to ON

Track: donation completion, newsletter signup, event registration, volunteer form submission.

### Dashboard options

| Tool | Best for | Free tier |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Google Sheets** | Very small groups | Unlimited |
| **Databox** | Easiest all-in-one | 3 dashboards, 60+ integrations |
| **Looker Studio** | GA4 integration | Unlimited (2-4 hour learning curve) |

**Recommendation**: Start with a simple monthly spreadsheet. Graduate to Databox when ready for automation.

### Time commitment

| Task | Frequency | Time |
|------|-----------|------|
| Monthly data check | Monthly | 15-30 min |
| Social insights review | Monthly | 10-15 min |
| Quarterly board report | Quarterly | 1-2 hours |

**Total realistic commitment: 1-2 hours monthly** for basic analytics.

## Qualitative measures: Beyond the numbers

### Member satisfaction

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** works well for community groups:
- Question: "How likely are you to recommend [group] to a friend?" (0-10)
- NPS = % Promoters (9-10) minus % Detractors (0-6)
- **Target**: 30+ is healthy; 50+ is excellent

**Quarterly pulse survey (5 questions maximum):**
1. How satisfied are you with [organisation] this quarter? (1-5)
2. What have you found most valuable recently? (open)
3. How could we better serve you? (open)
4. NPS question (0-10)
5. How likely are you to renew/stay involved? (1-5)

### Volunteer and committee wellbeing

**Warning signs to monitor:**
- Reduced meeting attendance
- Missed deadlines or incomplete tasks
- Expressing feeling overwhelmed
- Declining to take on responsibilities they'd usually accept

**Simple wellbeing check (ask volunteers annually):**
1. How manageable is your current workload? (1-5)
2. Do you feel your contributions are valued? (1-5)
3. Do you have adequate support and resources? (1-5)

**Committee health indicators:**
- Meeting attendance rate (target: 75%+)
- Actions completed between meetings
- Fair workload distribution

### Capturing stories systematically

At every event, assign someone to collect **one good quote or story**. Ask:
- "What difference has this made for you?"
- "What would you tell someone considering joining?"

Store these in a simple document. Use them in grant applications, newsletters, and reports.

## The quarterly report card for Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley

Here are the **5 numbers your committee should track quarterly**, designed to be simple to gather, meaningful to interpret, and actionable for volunteers.

### 📊 Quarterly Report Card

| # | Metric | How to Find It | Target ("Good") | Red Flag |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **1** | **Facebook Group active members %** | Facebook Group Insights → Members → Active members ÷ Total members × 100 | **70-80%** | Below 50% |
| **2** | **Event attendance rate** | Attendees ÷ Capacity or Expected × 100 | **60-75%** of promoted capacity | Below 40% |
| **3** | **Email open rate** | Your email platform (Mailchimp, etc.) → Campaign reports | **35-45%** | Below 20% |
| **4** | **New member/volunteer sign-ups** | Count from your records | **Positive quarter-on-quarter** | Two consecutive declining quarters |
| **5** | **Committee capacity score** | Quick 1-5 vote at quarterly meeting: "How sustainable does our workload feel?" Average the scores | **3.5 or above** | Below 2.5 |

### Why these 5 metrics?

1. **Facebook Group active members %** — Measures whether your online community is alive and engaged. Unlike follower counts, this shows real participation. Your 3,900 members with 80% activity is far more valuable than 10,000 with 20%.

2. **Event attendance rate** — The clearest signal that digital outreach converts to real-world community connection. This bridges online/offline and shows whether promotion is working.

3. **Email open rate** — The health of your communication channel. If people open your emails, they care what you're doing. This predicts future engagement better than list size.

4. **New member/volunteer sign-ups** — Simple growth indicator that connects directly to organizational sustainability. Not expecting hockey-stick growth—just steady positive direction.

5. **Committee capacity score** — The metric most groups ignore until it's too late. A volunteer-run organization is only as sustainable as its volunteers. This catches burnout before it causes problems.

### Quarterly review process (1 hour)

**Before the meeting:** One person gathers the 5 numbers (15 minutes total)

**At the meeting:**
1. **Review the numbers** (10 min) — Are we on target? Any red flags?
2. **What's working?** (10 min) — Which activities drove good results?
3. **What needs attention?** (10 min) — One action for each underperforming metric
4. **One story** (5 min) — Share a member quote or success from the quarter
5. **Next quarter focus** (10 min) — Choose 1-2 priorities based on the data

### Sample completed report card

| Metric | Q3 Result | Target | Status | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| FB Group active members | 72% | 70-80% | ✅ Good | Maintain posting rhythm |
| Event attendance | 45/60 (75%) | 60-75% | ✅ Good | Try earlier email reminders |
| Email open rate | 41% | 35-45% | ✅ Good | Test different subject lines |
| New sign-ups | 12 (vs 8 Q2) | Positive trend | ✅ Good | Continue new walk series |
| Committee capacity | 2.8 | 3.5+ | ⚠️ Caution | Redistribute newsletter task |

### What "good" looks like at a glance

For a group like Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley:

- **Facebook**: 3,900 members with 70-80% active = healthy, engaged community
- **Events**: 20-40 regular attendees at walks/activities = strong core
- **Email**: 35-45% open rate, 3-5% annual list growth = excellent communication health
- **Growth**: Modest but steady new member flow each quarter
- **Committee**: Sustainable workload, no burnout warning signs

The goal isn't rapid growth—it's **sustainable engagement** that keeps the Downs and Happy Valley protected for generations.
