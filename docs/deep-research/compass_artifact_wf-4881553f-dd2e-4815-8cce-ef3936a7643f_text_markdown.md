# Engaging multilingual communities in green spaces: A practical guide

Friends of Farthing Downs already leads the UK in multilingual nature trail engagement—the celebrity-narrated audio trail translated into French, Hindi, and Polish by **50+ community volunteers** represents a model other conservation groups are now studying. This report provides a strategic framework for preserving and expanding this work on a new website, while building deeper connections with Croydon's diverse communities.

The core insight from research is this: language access matters, but it's only one part of making green spaces feel welcoming. **Cultural considerations, representation, and community partnerships** often determine whether diverse residents actually visit—and return.

## What successful multilingual engagement looks like in UK green spaces

Surprisingly few UK parks have robust multilingual signage or materials. Most focus on physical accessibility rather than linguistic accessibility. The Farthing Downs Nature Trail stands out as a genuine innovation—one of very few UK nature reserves offering audio content in multiple languages.

**Parks with multilingual approaches:**
- **Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park** was designed with multilingual potential (serving Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Waltham Forest—London's most diverse boroughs) with BSL interpretation and multilingual WiFi interfaces
- **Kew Gardens** offers BSL tours and sensory tours but acknowledges "limited support for non-English speakers"
- **Royal Parks** are installing new standardized signage by 2026 with Quentin Blake illustrations for universal accessibility, but multilingual text remains absent

**Community gardens show more innovation.** Room to Heal Community Allotment in Stoke Newington serves refugees from **30+ countries**, finding that "visceral connection to gardening transcends language barriers." Spitalfields City Farm runs the **Coriander Club** (women-only gardening sessions) and the Connected Seeds project where "seed guardians" grow crops from their home countries, "drawing on expertise of migrant communities." Capital Growth coordinates 2,000+ member gardens across London and recently published a **Growing for Change Handbook** co-produced with 20 garden leaders from diverse communities.

**Wildlife Trusts have emerged as leaders in inclusion.** Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust created **bilingual wildlife identification cards** trialled with refugee families, now distributed across all 46 Wildlife Trusts. London Wildlife Trust's Keeping it Wild programme has engaged 1,000+ young people since 2016, achieving **19% staff from Black, Asian or minoritised ethnic backgrounds** compared to ~3% sector average. Birmingham & Black Country Wildlife Trust's Natural Prospects offers paid conservation traineeships specifically targeting minority ethnic communities.

## Translation strategy for a small community website

The evidence strongly supports a **"key pages first"** approach rather than translating everything. Expert guidance consistently recommends prioritizing: homepage, about us, contact page, navigation menus, and your most-visited content. A typical community website with ~5,000 words can be professionally translated into French, Hindi, and Polish for **£1,800-2,000**—but a hybrid approach using AI translation with volunteer review can achieve acceptable quality for **£0-300**.

**Human vs AI translation trade-offs are increasingly nuanced.** DeepL achieves 89% accuracy for European languages and outperforms Google Translate for French and Polish. However, **Google Translate works better for Hindi** since DeepL doesn't support it. A 2024 Lokalise study found LLM translations achieved 78% acceptance rate in expert evaluation. The recommended approach: use AI (DeepL for French/Polish, Google for Hindi) for first drafts, then have native-speaking volunteers review key pages. This "machine translation post-editing" cuts costs by ~40% compared to full human translation.

**WordPress multilingual plugins comparison:**

| Plugin | Cost | Best for |
|--------|------|----------|
| Polylang (free) | £0 | Tight budgets, simple sites |
| TranslatePress | ~£72/year | Non-technical users, visual editing |
| WPML | ~£67/year | Full control, professional workflow |
| Weglot | ~£180/year | Hands-off, auto-updates |

**Maintaining translations when content changes** is solvable. WPML marks content needing updates when source text changes. Weglot automatically reflects changes across translations instantly. A simple manual workflow for small organizations: designate a translation coordinator, create a change log spreadsheet, set a monthly review schedule.

**Charity Translators** (UK registered charity 1162771) offers free volunteer translation support for community groups—contact support@charitytranslators.org for advice. University language departments and ethnic community organizations are other sources of volunteer translators.

## Cultural barriers extend far beyond language

Research reveals sobering statistics: **40% of people from BAME backgrounds** live in England's most green space-deprived neighbourhoods, compared to 14% of white people. Only **26% of Black ethnic groups** spend time in the countryside versus 44% of white individuals. The countryside sector remains one of the least diverse professions—only **0.6% of environmental professionals** come from visible minority ethnic backgrounds.

**Natural England's 2023 NatCen study** identified barriers across capability (lack of awareness, misconceptions about what spaces offer), motivation (perceptions about who spaces are "for," safety concerns), and opportunity (transport, English-only information, lack of representation). The Rural Racism Project at Leicester University documented experiences of "conscious and unconscious racial stereotyping, exclusionary behaviours and open hostility" in rural areas.

**What makes green spaces feel welcoming—evidence-based principles from Natural England:**
- Show diverse individuals doing fulfilling activities in promotional imagery
- Authenticity is essential—staged or stock imagery appears "fake or tokenistic" and backfires
- Show urban green areas, not just idyllic countryside (most people live in towns/cities)
- Feature groups and families, varied activities, and different body types
- Diversify who creates content—greater authenticity comes from diverse photographers documenting their own experiences

**Faith-based considerations are often overlooked.** Muslim Hikers, now attracting hundreds to monthly events, plans hikes around prayer times, pauses near water sources for washing rituals (wudu), created bespoke **outdoor prayer mats** with Adidas TERREX, and installed the **UK's first prayer direction signs** on a Peak District trail. They partner with halal-friendly venues for lunch stops. For women-only events, female walk leaders are essential.

**Making events inclusive for non-native speakers requires practical adjustments:** WhatsApp groups for peer support before events; sharing detailed kit lists and accessibility information in advance; buddy systems pairing newcomers with experienced members; visual route maps and GPS files; keeping groups under 30 for quality connections; finishing at social venues for bonding time.

## Croydon partnership opportunities for diverse engagement

Croydon hosts a dense network of community organizations serving diverse populations—but many have never been approached about nature engagement.

**Tier 1 gateway organizations (start here):**
- **Croydon Voluntary Action** (cvalive.org.uk) is the primary umbrella body for the entire voluntary sector, running the Volunteer Centre and the Croydon Refugee and New Communities Forum connecting 40+ organizations
- **Croydon BME Forum** (cbmeforum.org, 020 8684 3719) directly represents Black and Minority Ethnic voluntary sector with health/wellbeing programming
- **Asian Resource Centre of Croydon** (arccltd.com, 020 8684 3784) is taking long-term lease of Broad Green Library as community hub—established networks into South Asian communities

**Faith community partners:**
- **Croydon Mosque & Islamic Centre** (croydonmosque.com) serves 20,000+ local Muslims with 9,000 weekly visitors, has plans for "green" expansion indicating environmental interest, runs school visits programme and Radio Ramadan Croydon
- **Croydon Hindu Forum** represents 30+ affiliated Hindu organizations including SEWA (service-oriented, aligned with conservation volunteering)
- **Croydon Gurdwara** (020 8688 8155) offers Punjabi youth programming with strong seva (service) ethic
- **A Rocha UK / Eco Church network** can identify Croydon churches already engaged in environmental initiatives

**Polish community access** is via the Polish White Eagle Club in Balham (0208 672 1723), Polish Scouts Croydon-Crystal Palace, and the Poles in South London Project through Stockwell Partnership.

**Schools with existing outdoor/nature programming:**
- Croydon High School runs a dedicated Forest School with weekly lessons and Nature Club using onsite woodland
- Courtwood Primary School established "Wise Owl Wood" Forest School in 2012, offering den-making, fire-making, and outdoor cooking in Selsdon Woods
- Croydon Refugee Day Centre already includes gardening activities for asylum seekers

## Audio and visual content that transcends language barriers

The existing Nature Trail audio guide—**29 marker posts with QR codes**, celebrity narration, soundscaped with birdsong—is worth expanding. But visual content offers even better multilingual accessibility without translation overhead.

**Priority audio improvements:**
- Upload all audio to YouTube, adding auto-captions as a starting point (free)
- Edit auto-captions for accuracy (YouTube auto-captions frequently contain meaning-changing errors)
- Create proper subtitle files (.SRT format) in English first, then translate
- Consider dynamic QR codes that allow content updates without reprinting trail posts
- For audio hosting: YouTube (free, built-in multilingual subtitles), SoundCloud (free basic tier), or specialized QR platforms like Me-QR or Scanova

**Visual approaches requiring no translation:**
- **Wildlife identification apps** like Seek by iNaturalist (no registration needed, gamified badges encourage family exploration) and Pl@ntNet (identifies 70,000+ species via photo, works offline)
- **Icon-based trail markers** with color-coded discs matching printed maps
- **Photo-based identification cards** with illustrations on front, minimal text on back—the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust bilingual cards being distributed across all Wildlife Trusts demonstrate this approach
- **Picture-heavy trail guides** showing landmarks, plants, and wildlife at each stop

**Video content recommendations:**
- Over 2/3 of YouTube views come from non-English speakers
- 83% of mobile viewers watch with sound off
- YouTube's multi-language audio track feature lets creators see **25%+ increased watch time** from non-primary language viewers
- Focus production effort on first and last 20% of videos (accounting for 80% of impact)

## Minimum viable multilingual strategy for the new website

Preserving the existing four-language Nature Trail content should be the foundation. But a realistic minimum viable approach for expansion recognizes that **community partnerships matter more than perfect translation**.

**Phase 1 (immediate, low cost):**
1. Migrate existing English, French, Hindi, Polish audio trail content to new website with text alternatives
2. Install Polylang (free WordPress plugin) to manage translated pages
3. Translate homepage, about, contact, and Nature Trail landing page only
4. Upload all audio to YouTube with edited English captions
5. Create a visual trail map with numbered posts and wildlife icons

**Phase 2 (3-6 months):**
1. Contact Croydon Voluntary Action and BME Forum for introductions to community organizations
2. Recruit volunteer translators through community partnerships—offer acknowledgment on website
3. Develop photo-based wildlife identification cards with minimal text
4. Create a "Welcome" video featuring diverse local residents enjoying the Downs
5. Partner with one school with high EAL population for a pilot nature visit

**Phase 3 (ongoing):**
1. Establish relationships with 2-3 faith organizations (mosque, gurdwara, Hindu temple)
2. Run one pilot multilingual family event with translated materials and buddy system
3. Track which languages are actually being accessed to inform priorities
4. Create a sustainable volunteer translation workflow with native-speaker quality control

**Cost estimate:**
- Phase 1: £0-100 (AI translation + volunteer review)
- Phase 2: £100-300 (professional review of key pages, printed materials)
- Annual maintenance: ~£70-85 (TranslatePress or similar plugin)

The Farthing Downs Nature Trail succeeded because **50 volunteers from the community** contributed translations and recordings—demonstrating that language access works best as community partnership, not one-way service delivery. The goal isn't just translated content; it's building relationships with communities who feel ownership of their local green space.
