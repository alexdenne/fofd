# How to attract under-35s to nature volunteering

**The secret isn't better marketing—it's fundamentally rethinking what you're offering.** Younger people want community first, nature second. The organizations succeeding with under-35s have cracked a simple code: lead with belonging, make participation flexible, and never underestimate the power of ending at a pub. The RSPB increased TikTok followers by 190% in a single year not through better nature content, but by trusting a young hire to create "unhinged" videos with Gen Z cultural references. Meanwhile, Muslim Hikers grew to 141,000 Instagram followers by solving practical barriers (waterproof prayer mats, halal tearooms) that traditional groups never noticed. For South London green spaces, this research points to three priorities: create events that feel like social occasions with a nature backdrop, use Instagram Reels as your primary outreach channel, and frame everything around "nature recovery" rather than "conservation."

## The organizations getting youth engagement right share one trait

Every successful case study—from the RSPB's TikTok breakthrough to Black Girls Hike's grassroots growth—reveals the same insight: **young people join communities, not organizations**. They're attracted to identity, belonging, and purpose in that order.

Black Girls Hike started in March 2019 when Rhiane Fatinikun, recovering from a near-death experience, invited Black women in Manchester to walk around Hollingworth Lake. She arrived 90 minutes late to her own event with directions from the local newspaper. Fourteen women showed up anyway. Today it's Europe's largest outdoor group for Black women, with regional chapters across the UK and a Berghaus sponsorship. The power wasn't the walk—it was the sisterhood.

Muslim Hikers tells a similar story. Founder Haroon Mota launched an Instagram page during COVID lockdown in September 2020. By July 2021, his first in-person Snowdon hike sold out in hours, with one participant traveling overnight from Edinburgh. The group now has **141,000 Instagram followers** and events selling out within hours, attracting 150+ attendees each. When racist comments flooded their December 2021 Christmas hike photos, Mota's dignified response tripled their following overnight.

Flock Together, the birdwatching collective for people of colour, made birdwatching feel *cool*—no small feat. Co-founder Ollie Olanipekun runs a creative agency; he brought marketing sophistication to birding. Their North Face x Gucci campaign put birdwatching in Vogue and Hypebeast. They now have chapters in Tokyo, Toronto, and New York, plus a published book and an album of nature sounds.

What unites these groups is **identity-first naming**. "Black Girls Hike," "Muslim Hikers," "Flock Together...for people of colour"—each signals immediately who belongs. Traditional groups use location or activity names (Ramblers, Peak District Walking Club). The identity signal matters more than the activity.

## The RSPB's TikTok turnaround reveals what actually works digitally

The RSPB's age problem is stark: **49% of members are over 65**. Internal documents acknowledged their "organisational reach within the 16-24-year-old audience is currently very low." Their initial TikTok presence, launched in 2021, flopped—videos "didn't stand out or have their own character" and viewers scrolled past without knowing they'd seen RSPB content.

The breakthrough came when they hired Yas Devi, a TikTok Social Executive with platform experience, and gave her genuine creative freedom—even for content that wasn't traditionally "on brand." The result was "Bird of the Week," a humorous weekly series featuring birds with Gen Z cultural references, trending music, and meme-style presentation. The format included a spinning wheel, in-jokes, and a theme tune reminiscent of a TV game show.

The results from January to November 2024 were extraordinary: TikTok followers jumped **190%** (from 60K to 175K), views hit 37 million, and shares exceeded 1 million. A merchandise line launched via TikTok Shop. Most importantly, there was a direct uplift in younger membership sign-ups. As the RSPB noted: "What started as a fun idea to engage younger audiences with our brand has become a cultural phenomenon."

The RSPB's other youth strategies reinforce this theme. They removed entry fees for 16-24 year olds at 21 reserves (recognizing cost as a main barrier), created a Youth Council with genuine governance roles including seats on board committees, and developed animated campaigns with BAFTA-winning studios specifically designed for TikTok's format. The key phrase from their research: more than **80% of 16-24 year olds** agree nature benefits their mental health—the demand exists; barriers just need removing.

## The Orchard Project takes a different but equally effective approach

While the RSPB went digital, The Orchard Project (UK's only national charity focused on community orchards) built youth engagement through **tangible skill-building** and urban accessibility. Their secret weapon is the Certificate in Community Orcharding—the UK's only accredited Level-3 course in the field. This matters because **25% of volunteers found new employment** through skills obtained via their training programs.

Their urban focus resonates with young professionals: orchards in "food deserts" on housing estates, schools, universities, and even prisons. They frame their work around climate action and food justice—issues that animate younger demographics—rather than heritage preservation. And they make entry accessible: many workshops are free, no experience is required, and volunteers can progress from basic tasks to leadership to becoming mentors who teach others.

The event format also differs from traditional conservation. Rather than technical work days, they run Apple Days, Wassails (traditional winter orchard festivals), and Blossom Picnics that create social occasions around orchards. Impact statistics show **79% of beneficiaries** report improved physical and mental wellbeing, and **93% of volunteers** feel more connected to nature.

## Instagram and TikTok require completely different strategies

For a small volunteer group with limited resources, **Instagram should be your priority**. TikTok's viral reach is tempting, but it requires near-daily posting, trend awareness, and someone comfortable on camera. Instagram offers better conversion to actual action (showing up at events) and is more forgiving of occasional posting gaps.

The accounts successfully reaching under-35s in UK outdoor spaces share common traits. Individual creators like @zoe.tehrani (187.8K followers, UK hiking via public transport) and @geordieramblers (120K followers) lead with personality, not polished production. Walking groups like Walk This Way went viral—their February 2025 London hike had 150 attendees purely through Instagram promotion. Local accounts like @wild_south_london host free walks in South London with strong community engagement.

Research on visual aesthetics is clear: **authentic beats polished for under-35s**. Gen Z favours user-generated content over branded material. "Overly polished content may feel out of place." Photos with faces get **38% more likes**. Content showing "close encounters with nature" performs well, but memes and humorous narratives work equally effectively.

Posting frequency matters: aim for **3-5 feed posts per week**, at least **2-3 Reels**, and **daily Stories**. Reels drive the highest reach—generating up to 75% of impressions for smaller accounts—and should make up about 70% of content. Carousels get 114% more engagement than single images and work well for educational content. Stories signal an active account to the algorithm and should feel spontaneous.

For hashtags, mix popular tags (1M+ uses) with niche ones (under 100K). UK-specific tags like #ukpotd, #ukwildlife, and #walkingintheuk help local discovery. Always vary hashtags to avoid spam flags. Successful Reels follow a formula: strong hook in the first 1-3 seconds, trending audio, 15-30 second length, vertical format, and text overlays for accessibility. "Hidden gem" reveals, seasonal foraging guides, and wildlife encounters consistently perform well.

## What a 25-year-old vs 65-year-old social media manager actually does differently

The differences are fundamental, not superficial. A 25-year-old posts reactively—same-day content about weather or wildlife sightings—while a 65-year-old plans and schedules weekly batches. The younger manager uses trending audio on Reels (current songs, viral sounds); the older uses classical music or silence. Captions differ dramatically: "Obsessed with this morning's sunrise 🌅 who else is getting out this weekend?" versus "Photograph taken 15th November 2025 by J. Smith showing the oak avenue in autumn colours."

Response time may be the biggest gap. A young manager responds to DMs and comments within hours, casually. An older manager responds within days, formally. The younger posts Stories throughout the day showing real-time moments; the older uses Stories rarely or never. The younger is comfortable showing "imperfect" content—rain, mud, bad angles—while the older shares only "perfect" conditions.

Platform behavior differs too. The younger manager checks notifications multiple times daily, participates in trends, uses Instagram's Collab feature with other accounts, and cross-posts between Instagram and TikTok seamlessly. The older manager sticks to one platform (often still prioritizing Facebook), doesn't use collaboration features, and remains unaware of or uncomfortable with trends.

If an older manager wants to reach under-35s, the research suggests: partner with a young volunteer for content review, spend 30 minutes weekly watching Explore/For You pages, use Stories (they don't need to be perfect), try Reels (even simple ones with text overlays), respond within the same day, show people (faces, volunteers, visitors), and add personality through first-person, casual language.

## Apps help discovery, but social media drives initial awareness

The walking app landscape is dominated by **AllTrails** (60 million global users) and **Komoot** (45 million users), with OS Maps serving as the British stalwart. AllTrails skews younger and focuses on discovery; Komoot skews older (largest age group is 45-54) and emphasizes technical route planning for cyclists and experienced hikers. Local groups **can add trails to AllTrails** for free—any user can submit via GPS recording or draw routes manually at alltrails.com/portal.

A positive finding for youth engagement: **70% of Gen Z** say they can confidently read a map, attributed primarily to smartphone mapping app usage. Strava data shows walking is now the **second most-recorded activity** on the platform (after running), with UK walking/hiking showing the biggest increase versus other countries. Gen Z is twice as likely as Gen X to track multiple activities including walking.

However, research from the University of Exeter (2024) confirms that young people's engagement with **Instagram and TikTok** shapes how they understand and interact with nature before apps come into play. "Screen-based nature" content influences offline behavior. TikTok's #mamtor (Peak District) has over 10,000 posts; teens discover locations through viral content and go for "socialising without drinking." The Lake District was named Gen Z's favorite Instagrammable spot.

For local green space organizations, the implications are clear: **don't build an app**. Development costs range from £10,000-£100,000+ for native apps, with ongoing maintenance of £2,000-10,000 annually. A mobile-responsive website costs £500-5,000 with minimal ongoing costs. The successful approach is to prioritize an excellent mobile website, list trails on AllTrails/Komoot/OS Maps (free), and focus resources on Instagram presence and community content rather than technology infrastructure.

## Three specific events for a South London green space

Based on all evidence gathered, these three events would most effectively attract under-35s who aren't already "nature people":

**"Wild Food & Wine" Foraging Picnic.** Foraging has achieved what TimeOut UK calls "meme status" with millennials in London. The appeal is multi-layered: it connects to wellness trends (Gen Z prioritizes gut health and natural foods), offers free food during a cost-of-living crisis, provides shareable social media content, delivers tangible skill acquisition, and links to sustainability values. Format: a 90-minute foraging walk identifying edible plants, followed by an outdoor picnic with bring-your-own drinks. End with communal cooking/tasting of foraged items. Evening or weekend timing; completely one-off commitment. Create a branded hashtag for social sharing.

**Sunset Photography Walk with Pub Finish.** Photography walks are growing rapidly with younger demographics who want "Instagrammable" content. Photowalk.me has 1,900+ members, many younger creatives. The formula: golden hour timing creates beautiful light, smartphone-friendly approach removes equipment barriers, and ending at a local pub with photo-sharing creates social glue. Research shows photography walks help young people "establish social bonds" in green spaces. Consider partnering with a local camera club or photographer for credibility.

**Full Moon Night Walk.** Following the Nature Vibezzz model, which runs successfully in Lambeth, Southwark, and Greenwich. The "experience" framing makes this feel special rather than routine. Include bat spotting, owl listening, or star-gazing elements. Evening timing works for working adults. Night photography opportunities are highly shareable—atmospheric shots perform well on social platforms. The slight mystery of a night walk creates talking points and word-of-mouth recruitment.

What makes events shareable: unique visual elements (wildflowers, sunset lighting, unusual wildlife), group photo opportunities, tangible takeaways (foraged food, photography), narrative elements ("I foraged this"), branded hashtags, and unusual timing that creates stories worth telling.

## Values and language matter enormously in attracting younger participants

Climate concern is deeply important to under-35s—**26% of UK young people** report eco-anxiety affecting daily functioning—but messaging determines whether it attracts or overwhelms. Research shows climate anxiety can drive pro-environmental behavior, but catastrophizing increases distress and causes paralysis. British Psychological Society guidance recommends information that is "age-appropriate, hopeful and action-orientated." Government advice: "Supportive, empowering communication that includes coping strategies and opportunities for action can help build resilience."

The word "conservation" feels institutional and static to younger audiences. UK Youth for Nature deliberately emphasizes "you don't have to have any background in nature, conservation, campaigning or politics." **"Rewilding" resonates powerfully**—it's positive, forward-looking, evokes wildness and hope, and is associated with exciting projects like Knepp. WWF describes rewilding as offering an "optimistic vision for nature recovery." The term **"nature recovery"** works equally well—action-oriented, suggesting improvement rather than defensive preservation.

Avoid technical jargon (biological recording, transect surveys), deficit framing without hope elements, passive language (preserve, maintain), and formal institutional tone. Terms that work: "wild," "wilder," "community," "meet new people," "experience," "discover," "take action," "skills," "learn," "fun," "adventure," "on your doorstep," "flexible," "drop in," "no experience needed."

## Flexibility is non-negotiable for younger volunteers

Research consistently shows young people **strongly prefer episodic volunteering**. A BHF survey found 30% cite "not having time to commit regularly" as their biggest barrier. NCVO found 21% didn't proceed because "it involved more time than I could commit." IntechOpen research confirms young people prefer "occasional, short-term and spontaneous types of volunteering activities to regularly organised ones." **37% of Gen Z** say they'd be more likely to volunteer if flexible hours were offered.

One-off events with clear start and end times work best as entry points. Don't ask for commitment upfront—create progression pathways. Research shows that once engaged, young people often continue (a "state dependence effect"), but forcing premature commitment drives them away.

Skill-building and CV value are major motivators. A UK Youth for Nature volunteer reported: "I forged a wide range of new skills for my CV: hosting live interviews, contributing to creative campaigns, dissecting UK environmental policy." Gen Z feel volunteering would boost confidence (42%) and improve mental health (39%). Specific skills valued include photography, social media, event organization, species identification, and leadership.

Young people want to *see* their impact. 81% of Our Bright Future participants felt confident they could "make a positive difference." Share photos showing results, provide certificates for skills gained, offer social media recognition, and make tangible outcomes visible. Youngwilders found that nightingales returning to their site was powerful evidence that made volunteers feel their work mattered.

## What volunteer tourism reveals about young people's motivations

Research on WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) participants reveals that motivations are "not always driven by an interest in organic farming"—travel and cultural experience often outweigh the work itself. The top motivations among 188 WWOOFers in Australia: meeting local people (34%), experiencing Australian life/culture (31%), cheap travel (24%), life experience (11%), and learning organic growing (11%).

This has direct implications for local volunteering. Young people seek **meaningful experiences** combined with social connection. The travel element won't apply for local green spaces, but the underlying desires do: meeting like-minded people, gaining new experiences, and developing practical skills. Workaway's appeal reinforces this: 50,000+ opportunities across 170+ countries succeed because they frame volunteer work as "cultural exchange" with skill development, personal connection, and pathways to careers.

Youth climate movements like Fridays for Future maintain engagement through **local autonomy within global identity**, digital community building during fallow periods, cross-movement solidarity (connecting with Black Lives Matter, Indigenous rights, economic justice), and satellite support networks (Parents for Future, Scientists for Future). Their burnout prevention strategies emphasize treating activism as a lifelong project rather than an urgent sprint, finding community in collective action, centering joy and celebration, and giving explicit permission to take breaks.

## University societies reveal what students actually want

Successful university walking and conservation societies combine multiple elements. The GRAPE principle summarizes what students seek: Growth (personal development, leadership skills), Recognition (feeling valued), Achievement (accomplishing goals together), Participation (active involvement in planning), and Enjoyment (social activities and fun). Campus outdoor recreation research shows positive effects on mental health, faster friendship formation, and retention rates up to **18.5% higher** for students in outdoor orientation programs.

Successful societies run low-barrier weekly activities alongside signature trips (end-of-year multi-day expeditions) that reward high attendance. They integrate pure social events (quizzes, pub nights) with core activities. Nottingham Trent Conservation Society has run for 17+ years by mixing conservation volunteering with wildlife trips and social events like casual walks. UCL Nature and Conservation Society runs regular bird surveys on campus—accessible, ongoing, no experience needed.

Retention strategies include committee roles with clear descriptions, mentorship of newer members, public recognition, and WhatsApp groups for ongoing connection. The balance between social and activity varies, but successful societies combine core activity focus for purpose, pure social events for bonding, challenge/adventure elements for achievement, and low-barrier casual options for accessibility.

## The bottom line for South London green spaces

The evidence points to a clear strategy. First, **lead with community**: events should emphasize meeting people and belonging first, nature second—at least for attracting newcomers. Second, **make everything flexible**: one-off experiences as entry points, no commitment required, progression pathways available but not pushed. Third, **Instagram first, TikTok maybe later**: focus resources on Reels, Stories, and authentic content rather than trying to be everywhere. Fourth, **reframe your language**: "nature recovery" and "rewilding" resonate where "conservation" feels static. Fifth, **combine nature with social rituals**: ending at a pub, bringing food, sharing photos. Sixth, **show impact visibly**: before/after photos, species spotted, tangible results that prove effort matters.

The organizations succeeding with under-35s aren't marketing nature more effectively—they're offering something fundamentally different. They're creating communities first, which happen to meet in nature. For a South London green space, that shift in perspective may be worth more than any social media strategy.
