Next steps:
Message Lotte (number below) with new ideas for webhosting. Aim for Jan parallel go live.

Notion for the content?
Circle?
Wix?
New domain including ‘happy valley’.

Access or at least a document explaining who has access to all the social medias (and on which platforms there’s no activity/ownership?)




Haven't built anything at all, just have structure.

Jayn - Started working on farms, and horticultural - then sainsburys on the technical side, then went into the sustainability management team there. Then went to work at london stock exchange on the sustainability stuff there. Was sidetracked with parents, but seems like I"m taking on the secretarial role of FOFDHY - in Woodplace Lane - I have been on the committee for a number of years. I can't even sort my computer out of it goes wrong, I'm not technical at all. I did a lot of articles for publications front for sainsburys and sustainability.

Lotte - I'm a bit more AI focused, I moved to Woodplace lane 3 years ago, with the promise of building this website, I did some web design when I was younger, almost 15 years ago, when I had my own website company when all these modern things didn't quite exist yet - lots of actual manual design going on. I studied AI at university, did a pHd at that, and I work at Deepmind on Gemini. I've been trying to make some time to work on this website. Chris (he's not here right now) we decided we didn't want to build a website from scratch. We picked Wix - if we choose one of these services, everyone can contribute to the content on the website rather than just those who have the technical skills. Keen to be technical, and visual, considered being more of a graphic designer. I like the visual bits, but when it comes to actual positioning things on the pages, and make sure the whole user flow works well, I have intuitions on that and zero input on that.

Why Wix? UK-based company, better options for on-website payments.

Main aims: Want to make it easier for people to become members. Started with designing a new logo. Haven't done much since.
Payments being really easy. We want people to be able to come to a stall, scan a QR code, pay £5 a month, and become a member.
Desire to have younger members join - and be aware of the friends, and the downs in general. 
There's one person on the committee who does the facebook group and she's interested in that - She's also set up a twitter/x page.
Inspire the next generation of farthing downs protectors. They see 'FOFDAHY' being advocates for the land, and we want more people to keep the downs going. There's also the Downers trust who do various things like helping them buy sheep and put fencing in.
We also keep an eye on the planning aspects.

Wix vs Website -> 

Content on the website is already well developed. 

Jayne: Volunteering page desperately needs updating.

It's currently looked after by the Treasurer - Ian, he's got all the files at Caterham Computing or something. Probably since 2005. He's VERY keen for it to be a simple tool which can be updatable.

Chris - recruitment consultant - halfway between Jayne and Lotte.




What does good look like?
Jayne: If it's the 'go-to' to find out what's going on, what they can do, how they can spot X or Y. It's the place they'd naturally go to. We do events, walks, talks that sort of thing. If you can reach through social media, you can get a much wider reach. Facebook has reached 3900 likes/visitors/whatever without any management. I've asked for the numbers (hits on the current website etc says he doesn't know).

Lotte: More young members joining, the longevity of the members. Iain's job is almost inpenetrable than anyone elses. Once we've sorted that, it'll be a lot easier to get more members. The thing with websites, generally speaking, they always end up being kept up to date for the first year or two. Realisitcally speaking, it makes much more sense for us, to have the news updates sent around social media. Automatically posting that on the website as well, but the website is the technical portal for membership and the place you can reference other pieces of information which would've been challenging to share that from social media. A newsletter of sorts, attached to the membership.

AD: I mentioned:
1. Video + imagery + social media driving awareness (across All channels, powered by the content from the facebook group)
2. Followers like/subscribe to pages and social pages put out a monthly newsletter which invites people to receive this via email, whatsapp etc.
3. That newsletter encourages people to ‘donate £5 per month’ to friends of farthing downs and happy valley. 

Social media drives people to events.

Budget of FOFDHY - £1000 or £500 which is the total money that the group has. There's very very little money overall. Maximum £2000 if that. 

Timelines: Meetings we have with committee, where we talk about progress, 1 in October (the AGM is in November - that's just a public thing). January/February. Another one in May time. Those are some markers in the sand.

I suggest: Aiming for January as a parallel launch. It's busy in the summer, people love going to it in the summer.

Lotte: Most people rely on Facebook.

Best way forwards.

Iain is particular, he's in his 80s, is OK with this site being handed over.

Lotte can send over logo they've been making.
Big join us now.

Jayne - I take lots of pictures. 
The Rangers (Tom) Said it would be good if we could have a publications page (the City can't put them on as they're not "accessible" so we could publish them. He's quite frustrated.)

Personal notes: VERY good photos coming through regularly, very nice discussion, pictures of wildlife, cycling, rain, shine, all things wild. A few things beyond the downs too (the airfield in a storm, and a community garden). It’s probably worth a. Scraping this content to understand the patterns (and the key contributors), and b. Thinking about how content which is popular here could be repurposed (with permission - implied as part of the group’s T’s and C’s perhaps - elsewhere e.g. to other channels (with full sourcing credits). One note of an outsider talking about Coulsdon said “Oh for goodness sake, keep it quiet”. So there’s a fear of people ‘finding out’ about Coulsdon -> That’s worth treading carefully around.
