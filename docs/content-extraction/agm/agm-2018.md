# AGM 2018 - Guest Speakers

**Councillor Oliver Lewis** - Cabinet Member
**Kelvin Shewry** - Live Well Programme Manager

## Moving Forward from Masterplanning

Cllr Lewis has been a Council Member since 2014 (representing New Addington South) and became Cabinet member following May 2018 elections. He reported delays in implementing the 'Croydon Destination Parks' Master Plan due to staff changes.

### Happy Valley Master Plan

**Key Finding:** The Happy Valley consultation attracted the most responses and engagement from local residents and visitors - showing it is a much-loved and cared-about local open space.

**Council Commitment:** Work with local community to achieve aims embodied in Master Plan to improve public access and enjoyment.

### Proposed Improvements

**Accessibility:**
- Currently no disabled access on site
- Surfaced pathways to vista points with views across valley
- Natural play area for local children

### National Nature Reserve Declaration

**Major Announcement:** Natural England proposing declaration of new **National Nature Reserve (NNR)** in Croydon stretching from:
- Farthing Downs
- Through Happy Valley
- Coulsdon Common
- Kenley Common
- To Riddlesdown

**Significance:** One of the highest designations for open spaces (along with SSSI). Recognizes importance for:
- Wildlife
- Geology
- Accessibility for people to experience nature

**Partnership Project:** Natural England, Croydon Council and City of London. Opens opportunities to engage with schools, community groups and visitors.

**Cllr Lewis's Site Visit:** Recently toured Happy Valley with Countryside Warden Dominic North, particularly impressed by sheep grazing project and abundance of wild flowers.

### Role of Friends Groups

Friends groups can contribute through:
- Knowledge of area informing pathway and vista point design
- Bidding for additional funding and grants (as LA resources dwindle)
- Views on natural play area and trim trail replacement proposals

### Projects Across the Borough

**Completed/Proposed:**
- **Ashburton:** New skate park facilities
- **Norbury Park:** Deculverting of Norbury Brook, enhanced play facilities, outdoor Gym
- **Lloyd Park:** New recreation facilities (remains important events space)
- **South Norwood Lake:** New fishing platforms and trim trail
- **Park Hill:** Walled Garden enhancement managed by Friends Group

## Kelvin Shewry - Implementation Update

Kelvin has been in post for 4 months as Live Well Programme Manager within Active Lifestyles Service, overseeing:
- Play provision
- Elements of parks development
- Lead for driving Masterplan recommendations forward

### Masterplan Implementation

**Realistic Approach:** No immediate intention to carry out all suggestions - some projects take longer than others.

**Current Status:** Delay in implementation but work progressing on various fronts.

### Live Well Team

Team of 7 advisors work with individuals on 6 key health issues:
- Diet and healthy weight
- Lowering alcohol intake
- Increasing activity
- Mental health and wellbeing
- Stopping smoking
- Healthy relationships

**Outdoor Gyms:** 9 currently in borough, one more planned for Norbury Park. Funded by Council and mental health charity. Located on available outdoor open spaces in areas of need.

**Free Activities:** Programme of guided health and nature walks weekly.

## Questions and Discussion

**Q: Play Equipment Maintenance Concerns**

Questioner (landscape architect/project manager) raised concerns about:
- Out-of-date play areas
- Complex projects (aerial walkways) requiring large investment
- Maintenance requirements
- Risk of eventual closure without resources

**A (Cllr Lewis):**
- Play equipment expensive (15-year lifespan typically)
- Threat from arson/vandalism (e.g., Wandle Park fire destroyed £15,000 of swings)
- 55 play areas in Croydon, budget spread across all
- Recent improvements: more robust design, 'next day' repairs
- Proper contracting important - service window for speedy repairs

**Q: Happy Valley Development Plans**

Given SSSI status, are there development plans?

**A (Cllr Lewis):**
- No proposals for development of SSSI areas
- Large area protected by Higher Level Stewardship Scheme grant from Natural England
- Metropolitan Green Belt status and SSSI designation protect site
- Some non-SSSI fields may need protection
- Any proposals only with information and consent from local people
- Local groups involved in NNR declaration (New Year)
- NNR brings new research/monitoring obligations (can involve local people, graduates, post-graduates)

**Q: National Nature Reserve Information**

**A:** Natural England website: www.gov.uk/topic/outdoor-access-recreation/parks-trails-nature-reserves

**Q: Multiple Issues**

1. Muddy entrance/footpath from Chaldon Way in wet weather
2. Cemetery plans behind Fox PH (mentioned in report 10 years ago)
3. Knotweed on Tandridge border - control measures?

**A (Cllr Lewis):** No cemetery proposals for Happy Valley fields. Plans to extend Green Lanes Cemetery. Burial land is issue due to population growth.

**A (Dominic North):** Happy Valley surveyed for knotweed 3 years ago, problem areas identified and dealt with (Happy Valley and Tandridge). Continuing spray and control program. Plans to meet with Tandridge to review. Regular maintenance program for muddy footpaths ongoing.

**Q: Dominic's Office Future**

Current office at Grange Park in former Sports Pavilion. Plans for proper Countryside Warden's Office? Building may be converted to cafe?

**A (Cllr Lewis):**
- ID Verdi contract for ground maintenance terminates in new year
- Work taken back in-house (Croydon) - opportunity for new Warden's Office arrangement
- Sports Pavilion work on radar, tender documents prepared
- Pricing underway, more news in New Year

**Subsidiary:** If successful, cafe needs footfall (possible in Grange Park). Hope Dominic benefits from refurbishment. Could be useful local centre for leaflets and information on other local open spaces.

**Q: Funding for Master Plan Implementation**

Understanding that available parks funding was used for Tyrens survey. How is NNR funded? Where will money come from? How to keep funding going? Did objection to 'Park' description help?

**A (Cllr Lewis):**
- Tyrens survey funded from Central Council funds (Ambitious for Parks Project)
- Parks/open spaces maintenance from revenue
- Capital projects benefit from Central Croydon building project money
- Purchase of Colonnades and Croydon Park Hotel for income generation
- Funding difficult - need co-operation
- Partnerships think creatively, no easy solution
- NNR need not cost more, provides platform for extra grant funding

**Q: Trim Trail and SSSI**

Would trim trail reinstatement damage rare wild plants, contravening SSSI designation?

**A:** Projects proceed with knowledge and input from partners. New trim trail could be located on site of former trail (not on SSSI).

## Chairman's Summary

Nine months ago 'Master Plan - Destination Parks' released - question remained would it be shelved?

**Clear from Cllr Lewis:** Not shelved, efforts being made to bring many proposed projects to fruition.

**Friends groups** need to play increasing role in realizing Croydon Council's good intentions.

**ID Verdi contract** not renewed next year - maintenance returns to Council responsibility, enabling new dialogue between Council and public.

The Chairman thanked both Cllr Lewis and Kelvin Shewry for their encouraging presentation and for answering questions.
