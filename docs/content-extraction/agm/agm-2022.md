**Email Volume:** Increased from 20/day to 200/day - aim to follow up on all queries.

### Friends of Groups Engagement

**Site Visits:**
- Aim to visit all 47 'Friends of' Groups (FoGs) in Borough
- Visited 35 groups since May
- Exploring issues and problems unique to each site
- Pollards Hill and Waddon Ponds next
- Interest in Friends groups growing in North Borough creating own voice

**Staffing Needs:**
- Two new members of staff required to administer FoG funding
- Search for suitably qualified applicants may take time

### Practical Issues

**Grass Cutting:**
- Major problem identified
- Proposals to re-establish service
- Issues: larger mowers required, two broken, shortage of drivers
- Need to inform residents why Nature Reserve grass not cut
- Proposals to keep residents informed via FoGs, local Councillors, websites, social media
- Cutting can be coordinated with planned events

**Re-wilding and Wildflower Meadows:**
- More expertise needed
- Wildflowers grow in nutrient-poor soil
- Some projects not successful

**Volunteer Recruitment:**
- Council and FoGs work together through websites and social media
- Create closer working relationship with FoGs and stakeholders

### Refuse Collection

Met with crews (some 25+ years service):
- Frustration with current management
- Changed service structure and rounds rotation
- Problem of missed bins incorrectly reported (residents forgot to put out)
- Still collected - cost of time and money
- Council and Veolia working together on improvements
- Much to understand and establish

### Insurance and Funding

**Insurance:**
- Major problem for FoGs (£150/annum cost)
- Borough-wide liability insurance mooted
- Investigation requested: Can Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) be used for insurance?

**Section 106 Money Allocated:**
- £200,000 for green spaces
- £100,000 for trees
- FoGs can be involved in decision making
- Need to identify what and where
- Limit on notification time (developers can reclaim funds)

**Funding Cuts:**
- Cuts from non-statutory obligations (parks/open spaces maintenance)
- FoGs can apply for grants not available to Councils
- Example: Government grant £85,000 for Whitehorse Recreation Ground refurbishment

### Street Cleaning Services

**Improvements Sought:**
- Contract with Veolia standard category 'B'
- Recognition that streets have different categories
- App available for reporting problems - creates data and maps
- Graffiti removal and fly-tipping removal across Borough
- Asked that problems be reported
- Recognition of difficulties for FoGs needing more support

## Questions from the Floor

**Q: New Developments and Infrastructure**
Re developments of up to 9 flats in residential roads changing ambiance. Should developers provide funding for better children's playgrounds?

**A:** FoGs can help but applications require help from trained officer.

**Q: CIL and 106 Money**
Central Croydon development could provide millions but nothing seems available. Emission-based parking sensible but not working. Parking charges exorbitant. District Centres suffer. Need to re-think parking regimes.

**A:** Complicated problem being worked on. Recognize need to encourage use of local District Centres. Increase of short-term parking means less revenue. Electric vehicles reduce revenue. Re Croydon Town Centre: push to re-instate Westfield Whitgift Centre redevelopment to rejuvenate Town. CIL money not used because procedure lacking.

**Q: 106 and CIL Funding Applications**
Community has skilled people - why not use them as resource?

**A:** Officer in charge of 106 agreement but time element and more officers needed. Will meet with Mayor to work out strategy.

**Q: Biodiversity**
Ecologist needed in Planning Department. Developers destroying badger setts. 'Brick wall' between ecologists and planners who need to be 'more at one'.

**A:** Agreed - interrelationship needed between planning procedures and wildlife protection. Mayor currently looking at intensification strategy and how it relates to wildlife at local level. Legal requirements to protect wildlife acknowledged. Officers now refusing more applications acknowledging need to fit with local community not dominate.

**Q: Biodiversity Strategy**
Collapse of biodiversity is real. Strategy needed to know what we've got.

**A:** Lot of reports on biodiversity in Borough need looking at. Data and information needed. Strategy will be developed by officers.

### Cllr Roche Summary

**Staffing Crisis:**
- Severe reduction in staff
- Number of vacancies waiting to be filled
- Resulting reduction in services
- Required service levels difficult to meet

**Information Needs:**
- Need to compile and integrate information
- Currently no appropriate applicants to fill posts

**Biodiversity:**
- Replacement needed sooner rather than later for Mieke Weiss
- Competent environment officer still being sought

**'Cut and Collect' Equipment:**
- Needed following wild meadow mowing
- Each site has different requirement
- Officer would need to add machinery to available resources

**Parking:**
- Recognized parking difficulties and high charges drive people away
- Needs solution to keep people local

**Forum Needed:**
- For FoGs to share experiences, information and knowledge
- Current feedback: frustration, distance from Council, lack of action and communication, lack of appreciation
- Sympathy for current situation needing understanding and action
