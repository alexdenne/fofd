# AGM 2015 - Guest Speaker

**Christine Howard, Chairman, Surrey Hills Society**

## Protecting Our Open Spaces: The Next 20 Years

Christine Howard spoke about the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the challenges facing protected landscapes in the coming decades.

### The Surrey Hills AONB

The Surrey Hills area reaches from Farnham to the Kent borders and has protection equivalent to a National Park. It was the second AONB to be designated in England. The area includes:
- Chalk downland
- Heathland (Devils Punchbowl)
- Densely wooded areas (Surrey is the most densely wooded county in England)
- Rural areas (Surrey is 25% rural)

### Surrey Hills Partnership Structure

**Three Partner Organizations:**
- **Surrey Hills Society** - Run by volunteers to publicize the Hills and organize events
- **Surrey Hills Enterprises** - Business development and local economy
- **Surrey Hills Trust Fund** - Diversification to protect the future

The Partnership Board shapes planning policy, strategy and projects. A new management plan has been adopted by Councils and Parish Councils in the area.

### Problems Facing the Surrey Hills

**Population Pressure:**
- London's growing population (2000 per week increase)
- Increase in demand across the Green Belt
- Pressure on infrastructure
- High housing costs (average £580,000)

**Land Use Conflicts:**
- Four wheel drive and off-road vehicles damaging environment
- Increasing cyclist numbers (conflicts with horses and pedestrians)
- Leith Hill becoming a cycling mecca
- Farms going out of business due to land prices

**Development Threats:**
- Proposed expansion of Heathrow or Gatwick
- Fracking and oil drilling proposals (already at Leith Hill)
- Highway issues: sunken lanes used as rat runs
- Balance between infrastructure needs and rural character

### Funding Challenges

**Defra Funding Gap:**
- National Parks receive £53M annually
- All ANOBs combined receive only £6M annually despite covering larger area
- Surrey Hills must raise additional funds through events and business ventures

**Recent 30% cut to Defra funding** announced during the presentation week.

### Solutions and "Bright Ideas"

**Farm Diversification Examples:**
- Loseley Estate: wedding venues, conferences, office space in converted farm buildings
- Hampton Estate, Hogg's Back: events, holiday cottages, farm shop
- Renewable energy: solar panels, wood fuel production

**Conservation Projects:**
- Leith Hill Project: separate routes for walkers, horse riders and cyclists
- Tillingbourne Valley industrial archaeology survey (Lottery funded)
- Restoration of Tudor Gunpowder Mill and Victorian drinking troughs

**De-cluttering Initiatives:**
- Working with Parish Councils to remove excess traffic signs
- Replacing necessary signage with wooden signs
- Working with Sat-Nav companies to prevent HGV use of country lanes

**Fundraising Events:**
- Annual Wood Fair (first weekend in October)
- National Wood Fuel Conference
- Surrey Cow Parade (May-September 2016) - world's largest art display
- Surrey Life Food and Drink Awards sponsorship

### Community Engagement

The Society aims to inspire the next generation through events and projects for families and school children, ensuring the Surrey Hills are protected and appreciated in the future.

The Big Society Award from David Cameron gave the Society a chance to showcase its work and local Surrey food production at the Palace of Westminster.
