# AGM 2023 - Guest Speaker

**Mike Waite MCIEEM** - Director of Research and Planning, Surrey Wildlife Trust; Chair of Surrey Nature Partnership Biodiversity Working Group

## Biodiversity Net Gain

### Introduction and Personal Connection

Mike has worked for Surrey Wildlife Trust for 14 years. Two reasons for invitation:
1. Mike is expert on Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) - new legislation in 2024 covering sustainability and biodiversity
2. Nearly 20 years since Coulsdon Green Belt Association raised funds enabling City to buy Woodplace Farm Fields (west of Farthing Downs)

Chairman recalled just moving to Woodplace Lane and taking on fundraising leadership with only 4 days until Council auction. Local fundraising also contributed to City's purchase of New Hill.

### Mike's Background

**Previous Roles:**
- Lived in London 20 years
- Senior Environment Adviser on Biodiversity for GLA
- Senior Ecologist for London Ecology Unit (Croydon Council very much a contributor)

**Surrey Wildlife Trust (14 years):**
- Officer for Surrey Living Landscapes
- Promotes landscape scale approach to nature conservation
- Benefits to biodiversity high on agenda

### BNG Legislation Timeline

- **January 2024:** Major developments
- **April 2024:** Minor developments
- **2025:** Major national infrastructure projects (BNG not legal instrument for these)
- **Delay Reason:** Local Authorities waiting for procedure and guidelines from DEFRA

### Conservation Background Since WWII

**Site Selection Focus:**
- Access to the Countryside Act 1949: Creation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
- 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act: Greater protection (prohibitions on taking, injuring, killing, disturbing, disturbing shelters)

**London Biodiversity Partnership Plan:**
- Originally set up 1996
- Produced to complement national guidance
- Help London LAs fulfill duties to conserve biodiversity

**2009 Lawton Review:**
- Professor John Lawton commissioned to investigate Partnership effectiveness
- Found lacking in ecological coherence
- No opportunity for recolonisation
- Partnership disbanded 2013

**'Making Space for Nature' Report 2010:**
- Recommendations on connecting sites
- Landscape Scale Approach

**National Planning System Policy Framework 2012:**
- First policy for biodiversity enhancement
- Removed 'no net loss where possible' (following development)
- Favoured biodiversity net gain, nature recovery, restoration and conservation

**2019 UK National Action Plan:**
- Climate Change and net zero emissions by 2050

**Rio Convention on Biological Diversity (1992 Earth summit):**
- Development must be sustainable

**UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) December 2009:**
- 190 countries agreed to reversing biodiversity loss by 30% by 2030 (30x30 agreement)
- UK committed to 30x30 through management for nature recovery
- BNG very much part of this process

### Environmental Improvement Plan (January 2023)

Underpins:
- 25-year Environment Plan 2018 (government action to help natural world regain and retain good health)
- Environment Act 2021

**Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS):**
- Amends Biodiversity duty on Planning Authorities from April 2022
- All regions should work together to restore, create, and connect habitat
- Surrey County Council: supporting authority on LNRA for Surrey
- GLA: supporting authority for London
- Local authorities sign-up to supporting authorities in their region

### BNG as Primary Planning Mechanism

**Before Development:**
- Applicants measure existing and proposed biodiversity values
- National Planning Policy Framework encourages net gains through planning

**BNG Delivers:**
- Measurable improvements for biodiversity
- Creation or enhancement of habitats with development

**Surrey Nature Partnership Resource:**
- 'Biodiversity Planning in Surrey' document
- User friendly for planners
- Available on Surrey Nature Partnership website

### Biodiversity Metric (Defra Version 4)

**Assessment Factors:**
- **Habitat type:** hectares for terrestrial, metres for hedgerows/watercourses (to 2 decimal places)
- **Habitat condition:** Scale of 1-5
- **Strategic significance:** Value scale of 1-3 for geographical location

**Application:**
- Best applied by ecologist
- Calculated on three habitat units: Habitat, Hedgerows, Watercourse (not all on every site)
- Values extent and quality comparing before/after development

**Requirements:**
- Basic requirement: 10% increase
- Monitoring for 30 years (means yet to be decided)
- LAs can set own requirements (e.g., Mole Valley requires 20%, other Surrey authorities following)

### Development Scenario Example

**Site Including:**
- Chalk grassland
- Arable land
- Pasture
- Ancient woodland
- Natural woodland
- Brownfield site with housing potential

**BNG Achievement Options:**
1. **On-site:** Restore chalk grassland, manage ancient woodland
2. **Adjacent land:** Negotiate with neighbouring landowner to buy/enhance natural woodland
3. **Off-site:** Create wildlife habitat elsewhere
4. **Biodiversity credits:** Buy banked land credits from registered providers or statutory credits for national nature recovery projects (administered by Natural England)

**Land Banking:**
- Surrey County Council compiling land bank of suitable sites (including boroughs/districts)
- Noting potential BNG of each site
- SWT also compiling own land bank programme

### Important Note: Planning Legislation

**Amended Town and Country Planning Act:**
- Change between uses within same class doesn't constitute development
- Often doesn't require planning permission
- **BUT:** All planning applications will be conditional on BNG
- Developers must consider environmental impact
- **BNG itself doesn't bypass current planning legislation**

### Green/Blue Infrastructure and Mitigation

**Blue-Green Infrastructure:**
- Contributes to BNG metric calculations
- Reduces surface water
- Reduces flooding risk
- Improves amenity (attractive, usable space for communities)

**Mitigation Hierarchy:**
- Applied to all ecology aspects
- Potential for: avoidance, minimisation, mitigation, offsetting impacts on species
- Considered outside BNG approach
- Development impacts/losses of nature addressed
- Reinforces and complements Mitigation Hierarchy
- Mandatory BNG requires development to deliver more for nature
- Minimum 10% increase compared to baseline

**Mike's Belief:** BNG best met by preserving biodiversity on site rather than off-setting net gain outside development site.

**Environmental Assessments:**
- Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
- Must show application of Mitigation Hierarchy

### Main Problem: Lack of Skilled Staff

**Mike's View:** Local Authorities don't have skilled staff to implement BNG

**Surrey Situation:**
- Surrey County Council has Ecologist and Ecology Team
- 11 districts and 9 boroughs in Surrey do not
- SWT has ecology unit (can advise, usually look at Planning Applications)

**Current Baseline:** 10% for validating Planning Application

**Mike's View:** Should be higher, target may be revisited.
