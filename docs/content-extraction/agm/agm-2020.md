# AGM 2020 - Reports Distributed Online

**EMAIL & POSTAL VOTING: 15th TO 31st DECEMBER 2020**

The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the Friends hosting the customary schedule of walks and talks through winter and spring months. No fundraising quiz nights. Online AGM with reports distributed prior to meeting.

## Chairman's Report - Graham Lomas

### Challenging Times

2020 has been a year like no other. COVID-19 may lead to massive political and social change, having touched virtually every nation on earth.

**Economic Impact:**
- Britain faces steepest shrinkage in national economy for perhaps 300 years
- Widely differing predictions on recovery speed
- Likely high and lingering unemployment
- Talk of prolonged 'home-working', less commuting
- Possible hollowing out of central London
- Shuffling in housing market

**Unexpected Trends:**
- Despite belief that flats would replace semi-ds
- Despite belief open spaces would be forfeit as building land scarcer
- Now hints of suburban resurgence
- Pressure to greatly extend green spaces

### Croydon Council Insolvency

Grant Thornton report on £67M budget gap and PWC report on Brick by Brick losses make chilling reading.

**Immediate Casualties** (hinted at emergency meeting 23 November):
- Parks
- Recycling centres
- Leisure centres
- Libraries

### Good News: Nature Trail Completion

Late 2019: City of London invited Friends to bid for small grant to restore Nature Trail across Downs and Happy Valley.

**Phase 1 (February-June 2020):**
- Marker posts along Trail replaced
- QR and directional signs reinstated
- Help from Warden Dominic North, City Rangers Tom Oliver and Ed Sanger, Downland Partnership

**Booklet Production:**
- Earlier booklet on history and ecology rewritten and full color illustrated
- Shared work: Dominic, Ian and Pauline Payne, Graham Lomas
- 15 national celebrities (theatre, TV, film, music, poetry) narrated for smartphone
- All observable points along Trail covered

**Results:**
- "A first" - well received in local community
- Enquiries from elsewhere asking how it's done
- Formal publication: end of July
- Dominic negotiating audio narrations in Polish, French, and Hindi

**Grateful to:**
- ADVANCED PRINT in Coulsdon (stocking booklets)
- PISTACHIO CAFÉ in Old Coulsdon (selling copies of "Exploring Happy Valley and Farthing Downs")

### Going National: South London Downs NNR

Natural England designated major part of City Commons as **National Nature Reserve**.

**Ceremony:** July 2019 on Farthing Downs

**The new NNR includes:**
- Farthing Downs and New Hill (City of London)
- Coulsdon and Kenley Commons (City of London)
- Riddlesdown (City of London)
- Happy Valley (Croydon)
- Sanderstead to Whyteleafe Countryside Area (Croydon)

Named: **South London Downs NNR**
Jointly managed: City and Croydon Council
Joins Richmond Park and Ruislip Woods as third London NNR

### A Changing Community

**2001 Census:** Coulsdon's 22,000 population increasingly elderly retired, commuter suburb from 1930s, absorbed into GLC 1965.

**21st Century Changes:**
1. Cane Hill asylum replacement: nearly 700 dwellings, over 2,000 people (mostly young)
2. Town centre around Station Approach: 273 units, 1,060 people
3. Individual large houses rebuilt ('intensification'): 60 schemes, perhaps 1,000 people

**Current Population:** 27,000

**Age Profile Changed:**
- Under 15s: 22% (England: 19%)
- Over 65s: 17% (England: 18%)
- A town rejuvenated
- Thriving shopping centre
- Brick by Brick: 157 dwellings at Lion Green (five several-storey flats) will change profile further

### This Green And Pleasant Land

Coulsdon and surroundings remain remarkably green:
- Many tree-lined streets
- Careful landscaping at Cane Hill and bypass
- Ample well-maintained open spaces
- Private gardens
- No local crisis yet over carbon capture

**However:** Prized local open spaces bequeathed 80 years ago - nothing added since. Community now defending what it has.

**Warning Signs:**
- Loss of acres of greenbelt at Cane Hill (beyond asylum footprint)
- Inspector of Croydon's Local Plan requiring community groups to justify particular open spaces as 'special'
- Tyrens consultancy report broached more commercial approach to Happy Valley (caravan parks!)

**Friends' Response:** Paper "The Future of Happy Valley perspective by the Friends of Farthing Downs"

**Croydon Action:** Took back ground maintenance from Idverde, reviewing open spaces strategy in light of new NNR.

### Down To Earth: Volunteer Support

**Restoration Works:** Trail, Happy Valley, coppicing, maintenance helped by:
- Downlands Project
- Individual volunteers
- Groups of up to 17 volunteers through TCV (The Conservation Volunteers)
- Interest remained high despite pandemic onset

**City Rangers Support:** Host of volunteers helping with:
- Coppicing, hedge laying
- Ditch and scrub clearance
- Clearing holly, yew, hawthorne and bracken overhang
- Groups: Coulsdon Common Chain Gang, Kenley Common Volunteer, Riddlesdown Collegiate, Woldingham Schools, First Coulsdon Scout Group

**Real and practical public-spirited commitment** - Ironic that as public flocks to escape COVID, voluntary groups helping maintain sites had to be laid off.

### Looking Ahead

If established community services cut to stave off council insolvency, and paying off enlarged national debt means higher unemployment:

**Consequences challenge conventional views** about:
- Voluntary work
- Voluntary activity
- More of what has been statutory might have to be voluntary
- Example: Managing and running of Marlpit Lane bowling green

**Enabling Factors:**
- More homeworking
- Earlier retirement
- Less foreign travel
- Greater awareness of climate change

**New South London NNR** may help bring sharper focus as agencies work increasingly across boundaries.

**City Newsletter Challenge:** "As pressure on countryside increases and urban sprawl takes more land, nature no longer has chance to find its own equilibrium."

**Need:** Friends and several other voluntary groups serving different parts of NNR may need to share thoughts and approaches in complementing work of Natural England, City, and Borough in conserving these major open spaces.
