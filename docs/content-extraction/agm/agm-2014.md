# AGM 2014 - Guest Speaker

**Sue Ireland, Director Open Spaces, City of London**

## Maintaining City Open Spaces Round London – the challenges ahead

Sue Ireland began by telling us that she had always wanted to work in a National Park. She joined the City of London in 2008 after completing a Master's degree in Landscape Ecology and Design.

### City of London's Open Space Portfolio

The City maintains around 200 horticultural sites within the Square mile and 11,000 acres of open spaces around London (65% woodland). These include:
- Hampstead Heath
- Epping Forest
- Burnham Beeches
- The Coulsdon Commons (Farthing Downs, Happy Valley, Coulsdon Common, Kenley Common)

Each site has its own Charitable Trust and is managed under the Open Spaces Acts from the 1870s.

### Key Challenges

**Conservation Management:**
- Grazing schemes using cattle, sheep, pigs and goats
- Pollard management (using techniques learned in Northern Spain)
- New technology: invisible fences using collar systems for larger grazing areas

**Tree Diseases:**
- Massaria fungus on Plane trees
- Chalara (Ash dieback) - not yet on City sites but reached East London
- Regular surveying and treatment programs

**Visitor Management:**
- Dog control issues at Burnham Beeches - new regulations from 1st December requiring dogs on leads
- Increasing cyclist numbers creating conflicts with other users
- Need for communication with cycling groups

**Financial Pressures:**
- £17M deficit expected over next three years
- Heritage Lottery Fund identified 50% cut in park budgets nationally
- Need to find sustainable solutions while maintaining quality

### Future Strategy

The City is reviewing the Open Spaces Acts to ensure continued availability, exploring:
- New income generation (e.g. car parking fees)
- Letting unused lodges to cover upkeep costs
- Maintaining status quo without dramatic changes

### Partnership Approach

Volunteers are essential to supporting site management and will be crucial over the next three years. The Mayor's Office London Infrastructure Plan addresses investment needs for London's Green Spaces, with grants available from Higher Level Stewardship Scheme and Lottery Fund.

The Parks Alliance was set up in 2014 to encourage politicians to think more about green space and the future of our landscape.
