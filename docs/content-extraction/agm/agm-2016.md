# AGM 2016 - Guest Speaker

**Dominic North, Ranger, Happy Valley**

## A Guided Tour of Happy Valley

Dominic North provided an in-depth look at the ecology, management and conservation of Happy Valley.

### History and Geology

The 250 acre site was bought in 1937 by Coulsdon & Purley UDC under the Green Belt Act. The area includes:
- Devilsden Wood
- Glebelands (given by Caterham & Warlingham UDC)
- Parson Pightle Estate (added later)

The name 'Happy Valley' was given in 1970. The steep-sided dry valley was formed during the last Ice Age and is mainly chalk with a band of clay and flint soil on the western slope.

### Conservation Designations

- **Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)** - Important for wildlife
- **Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC)**
- Forms a link between Farthing Downs (north) and Coulsdon Common (east), both owned by the City of London

### Post-WWII Challenges

Up to 80% of chalk grassland was lost due to:
- Lack of grazing
- Myxomatosis reducing rabbit population
- Land leased to farmer for haymaking which was not carried out
- Resulting scrub invasion

**Recovery:** When management returned to Croydon Council in 1966, Surrey Wildlife Trust advised on scrub clearance and grazing project (1968/69) on Southern slopes, bringing improvements.

### Rare and Beautiful Plant Species

**Orchids:**
- **Bee Orchid** - Self-pollinating, flowers June-July
- **Pyramidal Orchid** - Bright pink pyramidal flowers
- **Fly Orchid** - Very vulnerable, on IUCN Red List, typically 10-20 found annually
- **Man Orchid** - Endangered, humanoid-shaped flowers, grows to about a foot high

**Other Rare Plants:**
- **Round Headed Rampion** - Nationally scarce
- **Woolly Thistle** - Now rare in London
- **Greater Knapweed** - Attractive to butterflies
- **Greater Yellow Rattle** - Nationally rare (only 6 sites in Britain), now abundant on Happy Valley and Farthing Downs

### Wildlife Success

**Insects:** Around 800 species benefit from increased wildflowers

**Butterflies:** Around 30 species recorded in annual transects, including new species like Silver Washed Fritillary

**Burnett Moth:** Day-flying moth frequently seen

**Roman Snail:** Schedule 5 protected species found on both Happy Valley and Farthing Downs

### Grassland Management

**Grazing Programme (reintroduced 2002):**
- More effective than tractor cutting
- Encourages wildlife diversity
- Protects ant hills

**Sheep Breeds Used:**
- **Hardwicks** - Saved by Beatrix Potter, eat thorny scrub
- **Jacobs Sheep** - Hardy breed, eat rough scrub, chase off dogs to protect flock
- **Speckled Face Beulah's** - Hardy Welsh mountain sheep

**Management:** 120 sheep weeks needed per hectare per year (varies with conditions, public use requirements, and rights of way)

**Volunteer Support:** Shepherds regularly check flocks for fly strike and other problems. Volunteers also help with ragwort pulling (burnt on site).

**Haymaking:** Valley fields cut by local farmer who keeps the hay.

### Devilsden Wood - Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland

The woodland straddles both chalk & flint and clay & flint soils, dating back many hundreds of years.

**Tree Species by Soil Type:**
- **Chalk & flint mix:** Pedunculate oak, Ash, Hazel, small clusters of Beech
- **Chalk & flint:** Wild Cherry, Hawthorne

**Ancient Woodland Indicators:**
- Bluebells
- Sweet Woodruff
- Bird's Nest Orchid
- Abundant Dog's Mercury

**Coppicing:** 15-year rotational basis (Neolithic practice). Varying heights support different wildlife, particularly Dormouse (protected species). Coppicing creates mosaic of different interconnected conditions.

**Dormouse Monitoring:** 50 dormouse boxes checked annually, data forwarded to National Dormouse Monitoring Program.

### Tree Management

- Hundreds of new trees planted
- Protected from deer with tubes and 5-foot fences (removed after 3 years)
- Open inlets left on woodland edge (sunlit, warm areas)

**Use of Cut Wood:**
- Hedge laying (ancient art, good for wildlife)
- Log pits encourage variety of fungi
- Charcoal made using steel kiln, sold locally at BTCV Office and countryside shows

### Bird Life

Variety of trees supports:
- Green and Greater Spotted Woodpeckers
- Kestrels
- Skylarks

Also provides habitat for Roe Deer, foxes and badgers.

### Other Conservation Work

**Volunteer Support:**
- BCTV and Corporate Volunteers replace posts, maintain steps, paths, gates and fencing

**Office Work:**
- Grant applications (Higher Level Stewardship Scheme from Natural England)
- Organizing guided walks
- School projects on Happy Valley

**Nature Trail:**
- Updated three 1970s booklets into one 50-page A5 booklet (printing sponsored by Friends)
- Posts and signage renewed
- QR code discs added (Friends website hosts link to Trail pages)
- New information board with lectern on Farthing Downs (2016 project with Friends)

Dominic concluded by saying that as well as being a pretty place to walk, there is much conservation work being carried out on Happy Valley to protect and encourage wildlife - and he believes he has one of the best jobs in Croydon Council.
