# AGM 2019 - Guest Speaker

**Jonathan Halls** - Artist, Archivist and Illustrator

## Wilderness in the City

Jonathan is an Artist, an Archivist and an Illustrator who grew up in Hayes bordering the Green Belt. He works with drawing, writing, walking, workshops and installations.

### Central Question: How Do We Value Nature?

Jonathan exemplified each aspect of his talk through slides: images, illustrations, drawings, fact sheets, and questions.

### Green Belt Projects

**Hayes Common Tree Project:**
Looking at how trees are suffering and what interventions can be made:
- How does light affect growth?
- Volunteer work with Friends of Hayes Common
- Crusade to engage people and get their opinions
- Allowing more light among trees - effects on flowers and birds?

**Fake Property Development:**
To get feedback on building in Green Belt:
- Set up fake property company
- Cordoned off fake housing area
- Put up notices
- Talked to local people and passersby
- Used drawing skills to translate woods into illustrated drawings
- Excellent way of engaging with people

### Defining Green Space

**Question: Does green space = open space = nature?**

Depends on definitions of each:
- What is 'green space'? Its use? Its value?
- What are 'natural areas'?
- What is 'wilderness'?
- How do we let nature do its own thing?

### Land Use in England

Charts and maps showing:
- Farmland, pastures, arable land
- Orchards, vineyards
- Moors, forests, lakes
- Grasslands
- Buildings, roads, airports, quarries
- Parks, gardens
- Golf courses, football pitches

**State of Nature:** May have declining value but perhaps growing support.

### Croydon Railway Nature Trail Project

**Observation:** Only wild areas in Croydon nowadays are the railway lands.

Jonathan wanted to explore nature along the tracks and invented a project:

**'Croydon Railway Nature Trail'**
- Produced posters showing birds, animals and maps
- Created leaflets and booklet
- Invited people to walk along trail (in theory)
- Question where nature should be in Croydon

### Network Rail's Land

**Scale:**
- 20,000 miles of track
- 50,000 acres of land
- 10 million trees

**Problem - Lack of Understanding:**
Network Rail's Vegetation Management Review requires:
- 6m width of track
- No growth above 6ft
- Contractors not required to have (and don't have) knowledge or expertise of trees and habitats

### A Different Way of Viewing

The 'Croydon Railway Nature Trail' idea offers different perspective on:
- Nature
- People
- Opportunities
- Jobs
- Public assets

**Examples on Disused Railway Land:**
- 'New Cross Gate Cutting'
- Addington Railway (linear) Park (suggested from audience)

### Major Suggestions

**Environmental Officers:** Whose job is to liaise with railways

**Need for:** Lobbying group / research body for Network Rail proposals including:
- Offices
- Schools
- Partnership with local communities

**Opportunity:** Railway corridors could link up existing nature reserves

**Review Needed:** Mix of nature and housing. Perhaps golf courses? (Nine nearby golf courses - too many?)

## Discussion and Questions

**Dominic North (Happy Valley Warden):** Had difficulty convincing power line authorities not to demolish trees along route. Thankfully, dormice habitats were saved.

**Resident:** Disappointed when trees cut down along track adjacent to Brighton Road. Could Jonathan recommend 'right kind of tree' that doesn't grow tall for railways? **Jonathan:** Mentioned Scots Pine, but said he's not a tree expert.

**Common Theme:** Many suggestions from floor: "You should approach so-and-so", "You should set up such-and-such."

**Jonathan's Response (to Chair later):** He's an artist and illustrator with pertinent ideas, but not an activist nor experienced with protest. However, very willing to act as consultant if local pressure group established.

## Chairman's Summary

The Chairman thanked Jonathan for coming and hoped some of his ideas could be brought to fruition. Great enthusiasm shown by members for Jonathan's presentation and ideas.
