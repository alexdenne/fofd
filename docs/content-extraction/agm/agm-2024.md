# AGM 2024 - Panel Discussion

## Housing, Green Belt, Brownfield, Grey Field: A Discussion on Government Policy

### Speakers

- **Richard Biggs** - Leader of Reigate and Bansted Council, Parliamentary Secretary for East Surrey MP Claire Coutinho
- **Richard Knox-Johnson** - Chair of the London Green Belt Council
- **Tom Oliver** - Conservation Officer for the City of London's Coulsdon Commons

### Richard Biggs: Reigate and Banstead Perspective

**Council Commitment:** Passionate about open spaces but pressure to provide homes creates difficult balance.

**Plan-Led Authority:**
- Not having Local Plan leaves area open to unregulated development
- Example: Tandridge without Local Plan - areas of Green Belt surrounded on three sides by development

#### Grey Belt Designation

**Concerns:**
- Description too loose
- National policy on developable land needed
- Difficulty: any Grey Belt development needs 50% affordable homes

**Example:** Redhill Station £1M upgrade + car park redevelopment for 250 flats
- Application refused - no affordable homes provision
- If included, project would be financially unviable

#### Housing Targets

**Government Policy Changes:**
- Reigate and Banstead requirement almost doubled: from 644 to 1,264 homes/year
- However, 2012 Corporate Plan not regularly updated (not legal requirement then)
- Local plan requirement remains 460/annum until 2027

**Current Status:**
- Sites examined for restrictions
- Horley: much rural land, 2,700 homes built
- Government proposals require 20% more development land (most Green Belt)

**Challenge:** Not sure how targets will be met
- Build high is one answer (Redhill Station tower blocks: 18 stories)
- Question: whose need met? Couples/singles working in London?
- How to provide affordable houses for families?
- What is affordable? 80% market value and 40% take-home pay?

**Government Action:**
- Reduced inner London numbers significantly (e.g., Croydon target down)
- Reigate and Banstead target rising
- Council could lose control if reluctant to meet targets

#### Other Issues

**NPPF and Gatwick North Terminal Extension:** Keeping policy team very busy

**Natural England Delays:** Extension of Surrey Hills AONB (to be renamed National Landscape) delayed due to consideration of Hampshire extension

**Parish Council Visits:** Highlighted concerns of areas not in Green Belt
- Developers prefer Green Belt (cheaper building costs)
- Brownfield sites need more work (often contamination)

#### Solutions Needed

**More Comprehensive Approach:**
- County allocated housing targets by constituency
- More consultation
- Neighbourhood Plans - not just about stopping building, but where development can take place
- Creating right environment

**Local Needs:**
- Homes for key workers
- Homeless families: 445 families in temporary accommodation (not good situation)

**Biodiversity Net Gain:**
- Requirement for developers to enhance natural environment
- Set at 20% by Surrey County Council
- Level may increase
- Surrey Wildlife Trust Officers advising developers (charged service)

**Health and Wellbeing:**
- Most important to Council
- Willing to work with partners to maintain open spaces

### Richard Knox-Johnson: London Green Belt Council

**LGBC Background:**
- Formed 1955
- Growing membership: 110 organizations in London Metropolitan Green Belt

**Publications:**
- 'Safe under Us' (2016)
- 'The accelerating loss of London's Green Belt – who is to blame' (2017)
- Map of London Green Belt (2014, needs updating for July boundary changes)
- 'All Party Parliamentary Group' and 'A positive Vision for London's Green Belt' (2019)

**Recent Activity:**
- Website and seminars
- National Planning Policy Framework seminar attended by 150 people

#### Housing Need Calculation

Method like "Duckworth Lewis cricket score calculator" - no one challenges, no one understands.

**2014 Estimate Outdated - New Two-Step Method:**

1. **Baseline:** Projected household growth for next 10 years (government's 2014 household projections)
2. **Affordability adjustment:** Upward adjustment where house prices more than 4x higher than earnings
3. **Cap:** Increase capped at 40% of baseline or 40% above Local Plan figure (if adopted/reviewed in last 5 years)
4. **Urban uplift:** For LPAs containing largest proportion of population in one of England's 20 largest cities, increase by 35% after cap

**Housing Cost Reality:**
- Current cost beyond reach of many
- Reason for housing shortfall
- Current target: 371,500 new homes/annum (may not be possible)

**Reigate and Banstead Example:**
- Current target: 644/annum
- New method: 1,264 (50% increase)
- Currently building 734/year: new method = 42% increase
- Current Local Plan requires 460/annum: new method = 64% increase

**Not Binding If:**
- Areas/assets of particular importance restrict development
- Adverse impacts significantly and demonstrably outweigh benefits
- **But:** AONB designation no guarantee of protection

#### London Green Belt Vulnerability

**Reasons:**
- 15 London Boroughs with Green Belt land
- 47 Local Planning Authorities
- 62 planning districts
- Results in piecemeal planning and development
- No overall strategy or vision
- LGB unique in extent - makes it vulnerable

#### Protection Actions Needed

- Formation of London Metropolitan Green Belt Authority
- Spatial planning (rational land use organization, balance between development/environmental protection/social objectives)
- Geographic strategy (strategic change with human needs and development)
- More consistency between Local Authorities (adjoining borders can lose large Green Belt areas)
- National body for referral of Green Belt development applications

#### Benefits of Green Belt Land

**Economic:**
- Flood prevention alone saves trillions
- Food production: £2M/annum turnover from people buying directly from farmers in London

**Environmental:**
- Carbon sequestration
- Only one Local Plan mentions these issues

**Health and Wellbeing:**
- Professor Jules Pretty (Essex University): 50% of population suffer stress
- Green Belt provides beneficial recreation, family time

**Other Benefits:**
- Protects/preserves nature and heritage
- Regeneration opportunities
- Prevents urban sprawl

#### NPPF24 Consultation Failures

**No Plans For:**
- Protecting high-quality landscape
- Designated areas safeguards for countryside
- Strategic approach to whole Green Belt
- Checks on urban sprawl
- Preservation of gaps between towns and London urban centres
- Promotion of urban regeneration and brownfield sites
- Food security mention

#### Grey Belt Designation Issues

**Without Succinct Definition:**
- Could refer to garages/car parks within Green Belt
- Could result in loss of thousands of hectares
- Cumulative effects on openness and attractiveness
- Loss of nature and biodiversity

**Problems:**
- Lack of clarity for planning applications/inspectorate
- Legal challenges
- Difficulty in definitions by consultants/legal profession
- Delays to Local Plans and planning applications

**Sustainability Questions:**
- Remoteness of sites
- Lack of infrastructure
- Need for car transport
- Lack of community cohesion

#### Brownfield Sites Should Be First Consideration

**Advantages:**
- Close to town centres
- Transport and infrastructure in place
- Appeals to younger people
- Affordable housing works
- Economic advantages: save infrastructure costs, regenerate urban areas (example: Kings Cross), create communities

**Current Status:**
- LAs required to have brownfield site register (not being compiled)
- CPRE research: London Borough of Enfield has enough brownfield sites for 37,000 homes (yet planning to approve Green Belt building)
- CPRE reveals: enough brownfield sites for 1M homes in London
- Currently 1M homes with planning permission not being built

**Developer Argument:**
- Brownfield too expensive
- Need government funding to clear contaminated sites

**Example:** East Hertfordshire Council proposal for 10,000 homes in Gilston area (now refused). Housing target: 17,000 between 2011-2033.

#### Call to Action

**Hope:** People get involved with threat to Green Belt future

**Belief:** "Time is on our side - if we hold it up long enough it will disappear!"

**Proposals:** Make Greater London first National Park City (based on Norfolk Broads example) - not progressed. London is largest forest city (at least 20% tree cover).

### Tom Oliver: City of London's Open Spaces History

**City Acquisitions - Victorian Times:**
- Coulsdon Commons: Farthing Downs, Kenley Common, Coulsdon Common, Riddlesdown
- Epping Forest (Essex)
- Burnham Beeches (Buckinghamshire)
- Head Office: Guildhall

#### 1850s-60s: Manorial Landscape

- Wasteland used by local people for grazing
- Collectively owned by Byron family
- Railway building pushed London further out - land needed for development
- Wasteland under pressure from enclosure threat
- Loss of 'rights of common' enjoyed by commoners

**Local Reaction:**
- Complaints about Byron proposals to enclose common land
- Challenged in High Court
- Family forced to sell land

**City Approached:**
- Residents realized City had money to buy from Byrons
- Ownership of land for public use came 80 years before National Trust creation by Octavia Hill

**Corporation of London (Open Spaces) Act 1878:**
- Enables City to manage Commons in perpetuity
- **Meaning: no building**

#### Rangers Through Time

**Historic:** Three-piece suit, bowler hats, carrying cane (West Wickham Rangers)

**Today:** Informal dress, 10 full-time Rangers assisted by volunteers

**Maintained Since 1883:**
- Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
- Habitat to 11 species of chalk grassland flowers

#### Epping Forest

**Characteristics:**
- Largest urban forest and open space in London
- Rich in ancient trees, biodiversity
- Home to ground nesting skylarks
- Close to urban areas

**Saving the Forest:**
- **1871:** 30,000 East Londoners protested fences in Forest
- Commoners smashed and burned fences
- Attracted Royal Family attention - stopped further development
- **1872:** Act of Parliament gave City right to buy remaining Forest (10% already lost)
- City managed Epping Forest similar to Coulsdon Commons (many more Rangers)

#### Recent Acquisitions

**New Hill:**
- Building along Chaldon Way stopped 1940
- Plans existed (road layouts, electricity stations)
- Used for agriculture during WWII
- Left fallow
- Bought by City with donations from local residents

**Woodplace Farm Fields (2005):**
- Bought by City
- Donations from local residents

**Lesson:** Often saving open spaces requires co-operation between Local Authorities and residents.

The Chair thanked all speakers for detailed and interesting presentations explaining dangers and pitfalls facing London Green Belt future - clearly appreciated and valued by those present.

## Questions and Discussion

**Q (Don Davis, FoFD&HV):** Is LGBC voluntary organization? Criteria for Green Belt development?

**A (Knox-Johnson):** Local Councillors make decisions. Example: Tudeley Garden Village on Green Belt (2,100 homes). Tunbridge Wells Council dropped proposals due to resident opposition who met with housing minister.

**Q (Maureen Levy, ECRA):** Once permission granted, residents need £30,000 for Judicial Review. Too late once permission granted.

**A (Knox-Johnson):** Get legal advice from solicitor who writes letter with legal response to application (cost £500). Raise money based on letter.

**Q (Friends Chair, Graham Lomas):** Re speculative land banks and Surrey Hills AONB, much Brownfield and Grey Belt available within Surrey Hills (equivalent to 30,000 hectares immediately available).

**A (Knox-Johnson):** Landtech company fast tracks finding sites for developers' speculative acquisitions. Re Grey Belt: no proper definition, food production not in developer's interest.

The Chair thanked both Richards for detailed presentations explaining dangers facing London Green Belt future.
