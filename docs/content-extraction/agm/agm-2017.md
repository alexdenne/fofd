# AGM 2017 - Guest Speakers

**Councillor Timothy Godfrey** - Croydon's 'Ambitious for Parks Project'
**Juliet Stevenson** - Croydon Council's Live Well Co-ordinator

## Background: Council Funding Challenges

Cllr Godfrey outlined the severe financial pressures facing Croydon Council:
- Local Council funding cut successively over nine years
- Government requirement for smaller local government
- Council's grant from government cut by 80-90% by end of next five years
- Increase in demand for social services and school funding
- £100M borrowed for new school buildings (must be repaid)

### Impact on Parks and Open Spaces

Four years ago, reorganization of parks under ID Verdi contract brought £½M savings but impacted parks quality. The ID Verdi contract was due for review in 2018.

Cllr Godfrey emphasized: **Parks and open spaces are not high on political agenda and Local Authorities have no statutory obligation for their care.**

## Ambitious for Parks Programme

### Tyrens UK Survey

Design-led sustainable landscape practice engaged to survey Croydon's six open spaces, funded from central council resources to help unlock Croydon's £1.6M planning gain fund.

**Tyrens' Remit:**
- Look at projects to make maintenance easier
- Bring improvements to parks and open spaces
- Discover more funding streams

**Proposals for Happy Valley (September consultation):**
- Improved access
- Improved Ranger facilities
- Easier access for maintenance
- Better site signposting
- Fund raising projects

### National Nature Reserve Designation

Cllr Godfrey announced that Natural England had designated the major part of the City Commons as a **National Nature Reserve (NNR)**.

**The South London Downs NNR includes:**
- Farthing Downs and New Hill (City of London)
- Coulsdon and Kenley Commons (City of London)
- Riddlesdown (City of London)
- Happy Valley (Croydon)
- Sanderstead to Whyteleafe Countryside Area (Croydon)

Jointly managed by the City and Croydon Council, this joins Richmond Park and Ruislip Woods as London's third NNR.

**Benefits of NNR Status:**
- Platform for extra funding through grants
- No additional cost
- Provides opportunity for research and monitoring (can involve local people, graduates, post-graduates)

### Future Funding Strategy

**Revenue Sources:**
- Income from Central Croydon building projects
- Purchase of Colonnades and Croydon Park Hotel for income generation
- Car parking fees
- Possible letting of unused City lodges at Epping

**Partnership Approach:**
- More involvement needed from friends and voluntary groups
- Voice of people who care about sites needs to be heard
- Friends groups to supplement Council responsibilities
- Council Officers to work closely with residents, friends groups and volunteers

**Examples:**
- Mitcham Common Conservators Group (Cllr Godfrey is Chairman)
- Local contractors hired to support workforce
- New dialogue with ID Verdi contract ending

## Live Well Programme - Juliet Stevenson

Juliet presented Croydon's Motivational Interview (MI) programme for improving community health.

### Background

- Physical Activity Specialist on MyAction Programme
- MSc in Preventative Cardiology
- Croydon GoodGym Trainer (combining exercise with helping less able in community)

### Health Challenges

**North vs South Borough:**
- Life expectancy 10 years shorter in north due to poor life choices
- North has higher rates of: smoking, obesity, inactivity, alcohol problems

### MI Programme Services

**12-week interview courses** help people deal with:
- Smoking
- Obesity
- Inactivity
- Alcohol problems

People can "dip in and out" over 12-month period (e.g., move from stopping smoking to weight management).

**Access Points:**
- Regular drop-in health clubs at local Libraries
- 'justbe' website with YouTube links
- Support for pregnant women in deprived areas
- Mental health support
- Behavioral change support

**Results:**
- 91% on stop smoking programme successfully gave up
- 70% on weight loss program had successful reduction
- Increased 'happiness scores' and general outlook improvements

### Tollers Estate Issues

Juliet aware of problems for Tollers Estate residents:
- 'Cut-off' by poor transport links to Coulsdon Town Centre
- Children's play park in poor repair, needs modernization
- Request for outdoor Gym (like Marlpit Lane Memorial Ground)

**Response:** Dedicated team of advisors working to find solutions. Cllr Godfrey referred to 5-year programme for parks with funding opportunities from Local Councillors' budget.

## Discussion: Happy Valley Status and Future

**Strong consensus from meeting:** Happy Valley is a Nature Reserve, not a park, and should be left untouched.

**Chairman's submission:** 20-page document to Tyrens and Bartholomew Wren (Council's Regeneration Officer) outlining site history and conservation tasks.

**Ranger Coverage:** Reduced from three to one over last 20 years (plus volunteers).

**Annual Country Fairs:** Concerns raised about rare wildflowers spreading up from valley. Higher Level Stewardship Scheme (HLSS) covers fields to Fox PH for next five years, preventing such activities.

**City of London Takeover:** Cllr Godfrey confirmed City not interested in taking over Happy Valley management at present.

The Chairman thanked both Cllr Timothy Godfrey and Juliet Stevenson for their interesting and informative presentations.
