# Living in Coulsdon 2000 Years Ago

*Marking the early history of Coulsdon through an Exhibition and related activity on the Downs on 2 September 2023*

## Introduction

The 75th anniversary of Hope-Taylor's work is an opportunity to reflect on:
- The light he shed on early history in this area
- Latest studies of Roman and Saxon history around Coulsdon
- How significant this area was 2000 years ago
- Interesting today's children in the ancient history of their neighbourhood

## The Bigger Picture

The map of Ancient Britain (2010) cites Farthing Downs as a site of **'early mediaeval' funerary importance**.

### Within 20 miles of Farthing Downs

Only ten other places significant in ancient history:
- **Five iron age defensive sites** (including "Caesar's Camp" at Wimbledon - unconnected with Julius' invasion in 54BC)
- **Religious sites** at Worth and Stoke D'Abernon
- **Bronze age funerary site** at Greenwich
- **Roman villa** at Lullingstone
- **Roman burial site** at Keston
- **Londinium** itself

### Early Settlement Patterns

According to Prof Fawcett, early settlers avoided lowlands "in favour of higher ground above the tree-line, and only below the tree-line where shallow soils could be worked with simple implements."

Anglo Saxon, Jute, Celtic-speaking Belgae, and Scandinavian migrants later favoured river valley bottoms where oxen-yoked ploughs could cope with heavier soils.

## Limits of the Evidence

The only hard evidence about early Anglo-Saxon folk on Farthing Downs is their dead bodies - **some two dozen in all** amassed through archaeological digs about a century ago.

Where they lived, how long they lived, what they ate, how they were dressed, their complexion and state of health remains largely a mystery.
