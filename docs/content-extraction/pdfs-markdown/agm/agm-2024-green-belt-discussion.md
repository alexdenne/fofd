# AGM November 2024: Housing, Green Belt, Brownfield, Grey Field

**A Discussion on Government Policy**

*Notes from meeting held on 6th November by Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley*

## Speakers

- **Richard Biggs** - Leader of Reigate and Banstead Council
- **Richard Knox-Johnson** - Chair of the London Green Belt Council
- **Tom Oliver** - Conservation Officer for the City of London's Coulsdon Commons

---

## Richard Biggs: Local Council Perspective

### Key Points on Green Belt

- The Council is committed to open spaces but faces pressure to provide homes
- Reigate and Banstead is a plan-led Authority - without a Local Plan, areas are open to unregulated development
- **Grey Belt** designation is "too loose" - a national policy on developable land is needed
- Development on Grey Belt requires 50% affordable homes, often making projects financially unviable

### Housing Targets

- New Government policy has nearly doubled housing requirements: **644 to 1,264 homes per year** in Reigate and Banstead
- Current Local Plan requirement remains at 460 per annum until 2027
- Current Government proposals will require **20% more development land** within the borough, most of which is Green Belt

### Surrey Hills AONB

- Decisions from Natural England on Surrey Hills AONB extension (to be renamed National Landscape) are being delayed
- Developers prefer Green Belt land for cheaper building costs
- Brownfield sites require more work due to decontamination needs

### Biodiversity Net Gain

- Set at **20% by Surrey County Council** (may be increased)
- Surrey Wildlife Trust Officers advise developers on requirements

## Richard Knox-Johnson: London Green Belt Council

### LGBC Background

- Formed in 1955, now has 110 member organisations
- Publications: 'Safe under Us' (2016), 'The accelerating loss of London's Green Belt' (2017)
- 'All Party Parliamentary Group' and 'A positive Vision for London's Green Belt' (2019)

### Housing Need Calculations

New two-step approach:
1. Take 8% of area's current housing stock
2. Apply 15% uplift for every unit rated above 4
3. Cap increase at 40% of baseline
4. Urban uplift of 35% for largest cities

### Vulnerability of London Green Belt

- 15 London Boroughs with Green Belt land
- 47 Local Planning Authorities
- 62 planning districts
- Results in piecemeal planning with no overall strategy

### Proposed Solutions

- Formation of a London Metropolitan Green Belt Authority
- Spatial planning (rational organisation of land use)
- Geographic strategy
- More consistency between Local Authorities
- National body for referral of Green Belt development applications

### Benefits of Green Belt

**Economic:**
- Prevention of flooding saves trillions
- Food production (£2M per annum turnover from direct farm sales)

**Environmental:**
- Carbon sequestration
- Health and wellbeing (50% of population suffer from stress)
- Nature and heritage preservation
- Prevention of urban sprawl

### Grey Belt Concerns

- Without succinct definition
- Could result in loss of thousands of hectares
- Cumulative effects on openness and biodiversity
- Sustainability concerns due to remoteness, lack of infrastructure

### Brownfield First

- CPRE research: enough brownfield sites for **1M homes in London**
- London Borough of Enfield alone has enough for 37,000 homes
- Currently **1M homes with planning permission** are not being built

## Tom Oliver: History of City of London Open Spaces

### City of London Land Acquisitions (Victorian Era)

- **Coulsdon Commons**: Farthing Downs, Kenley Common, Coulsdon Common, Riddlesdown
- **Epping Forest** (Essex)
- **Burnham Beeches** (Buckinghamshire)

### Historical Context

In the 1850s-60s, the Commons were Manorial wasteland used for grazing, owned by the Byron family. Railway expansion created development pressure, threatening enclosure.

Local residents challenged the Byrons in High Court, forcing them to sell. The City of London was approached to purchase the land, occurring **80 years before local parks and the National Trust**.

### Corporation of London (Open Spaces) Act 1878

Enables the City to manage the Commons **in perpetuity** - meaning no building.

### Current Management

- **10 full-time Rangers** assisted by volunteers
- **Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)**
- Habitat for **11 species of chalk grassland flowers**
- Ten-year management plans
- Monthly newsletters for each major section

### Recent Acquisitions

- **New Hill** - Building stopped in 1940; used for WWII agriculture; bought by City with local donations
- **Woodplace Farm Fields (2005)** - Purchased with local resident donations

## Key Takeaways

1. Green Belt protection requires coordinated effort between councils and residents
2. Brownfield development should be prioritised over Green Belt
3. Grey Belt designation lacks clear definition and poses risks
4. The City of London's management model offers lessons for conservation
5. Local resident engagement is crucial for protecting open spaces
