# AGM November 2023: Biodiversity Net Gain

**Guest Speaker: Mike Waite MCIEEM, Chair of Surrey Nature Partnership Biodiversity Working Group**

## Introduction

The Chair welcomed Mike Waite, who has worked for the Surrey Wildlife Trust for fourteen years and is currently Director of Research and Planning. Two reasons for the invitation:

1. Mike is an expert on Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) which became new legislation in 2024
2. It had been twenty years since the Coulsdon Green Belt Association raised funds enabling the City to buy Woodplace Farm Fields

## BNG Implementation Timeline

- **January 2024** - Major developments
- **April 2024** - Minor developments
- **2025** - Major national infrastructure projects

## Historical Context of Conservation

- **1949** - Access to the Countryside Act: Creation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
- **1981** - Wildlife and Countryside Act: Greater protection to wildlife
- **1996** - London Biodiversity Partnership plan established
- **2010** - John Lawton's report 'Making Space for Nature' with Landscape Scale Approach recommendations
- **2012** - National Planning System Policy Framework: First policy for biodiversity enhancement
- **2019** - UK National Action Plan for Climate Change and net zero emissions by 2050
- **1992** - Rio Convention on Biological Diversity (Earth Summit)
- **COP 15 (December 2009)** - 190 countries agreed to 30x30 agreement (reversing biodiversity loss by 30% by 2030)

## How BNG Works

### The Biodiversity Metric (Defra Version 4)

Assesses a site in terms of:
- **Habitat type** (in hectares for terrestrial habitats, in metres for hedgerows and watercourses)
- **Habitat condition** (scale of 1-5)
- **Strategic significance** of geographical location (scale of 1-3)

### Key Requirements

- Basic requirement of **10% increase** in biodiversity
- Sites must be monitored for **30 years**
- Local Authorities can set higher requirements (e.g., Mole Valley requires 20%)

### Off-site Options

If 10% net gain cannot be achieved on-site, developers can:
1. Negotiate with neighbouring landowners to buy adjoining land
2. Use off-site land to create wildlife habitat elsewhere
3. Buy banked land credits from registered providers (statutory biodiversity credits) for national nature recovery projects administered by Natural England

## Green/Blue Infrastructure

Blue-green infrastructure contributes to BNG by:
- Reducing surface water and flooding risk
- Improving area amenity
- Providing attractive, usable community space

## Mitigation Hierarchy

Applied to all aspects of ecology:
1. Avoidance
2. Minimisation
3. Mitigation
4. Offsetting impacts

Mike believes BNG can best be met by **preserving biodiversity on site** rather than off-setting elsewhere.

## Challenges

The main problem is that Local Authorities don't have skilled staff to implement BNG. While Surrey County Council has an Ecologist and Ecology Team, eleven districts and nine boroughs in Surrey do not.
