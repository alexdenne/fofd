# A Strategic Approach to Biodiversity and Open Spaces in Croydon

*A discussion paper by the Friends of Farthing Downs and Happy Valley*

## Overview of Croydon's Open Spaces

Croydon's **127 open spaces** defy simple classification:
- 13 Green spaces in ACCS, 18 similar not in ACCS
- 12 recreation grounds
- 9 nature reserves
- 5 ponds
- Remnants of the Great North Wood (Biggin Wood, Beaulieu Heights)

### Large Open Spaces (over 50 ha)

- South Norwood Country Park
- Lloyd Park
- Addington Hills
- Purley Way

### Golf Courses (over 60 ha each)

- The Addington
- Purley Downs
- Addington Court
- Croham Hurst
- Coulsdon Manor

### Southern Edge (Along North Downs)

| Site | Size (ha) |
|------|-----------|
| Happy Valley | 101 |
| Farthing Downs (incl. Woodplace Farm Field & New Hill) | 95 |
| Selsdon Wood | 95 |
| Sanderstead to Whyteleafe Country Park | 81 |
| Riddlesdown | 66 |
| Kenley Airfield | 63 |
| Kenley Common | 59 |
| Kings Wood | 57 |
| Coulsdon Common | 55 |

**55 of Croydon's most important open spaces cover 1,550 hectares** - prime assets worth potentially billions.

## Toward an Integrated Approach

### Context: A Turbulent Decade

- Massive expansion of house building (mostly flats)
- Borough in special measures due to mismanagement
- Services like open spaces face reduced financial support
- Key parks staff have left the Council
- Climate crisis requiring 'climate resilience' commitment

### The Political Challenge

- Years before Croydon returns to full solvency
- Council must specify what help is needed: money, manpower, or management
- Lessons from Tyrens' 2018 consultancy study (including Happy Valley) which "sank without trace"

## Seven Proposals for Smarter Working

### 1. Motivate Community Involvement Through an Open Spaces Forum

- Test whether communication is best via meetings, newsletter, email, zoom, or website
- Council should explain why voluntary action is now necessary

### 2. Focus on Ecology and Supportive Initiatives

- 40 years since London Ecology Unit produced 'Nature Conservation in Croydon'
- LWT Ecological Data Search undertaken in 2005 for Woodplace Farm Field and New Hill campaign
- **GreenSpace Information for Greater London** database maintained by LWT
- Croydon is one of only **5 London boroughs not currently a participating partner**

### 3. Smarter Working in the Parks Department

- Need clear vision and leadership
- Sharper division between ground maintenance and skilled park supervision
- Clearer job descriptions and responsibilities
- Redefine role of park keepers

### 4. More Emphasis on Effective Fundraising

- Skilled operation required given 127 diverse open spaces
- Knowledge of Trusts, Foundations, and Lottery funding needed

### 5. Future Proofing and Forward Planning

- Happy Valley now part of **South London Downs National Nature Reserve** (designated July 2019)
- Scope for joint management between City rangers and Croydon's Warden
- City rangers produce **ten-year plans** and monthly newsletters
- Several London boroughs appointing climate resilience specialists

### 6. Raise Public Awareness Through Service Diversification

- NNR raising expectations for education outreach
- Scope for peripatetic staff with specialist educational knowledge
- **10 junior schools and 4 senior schools within two miles of Happy Valley**
- Happy Valley once had three wardens

### 7. Maximise Free Help Through New Management Models

- **Streatham Common Co-operative** model in Lambeth
- "Directly accountable to the local community and responsive to local needs"
- Friends willing to arrange exploration of this model

## Working with the Community

### Association of Croydon Conservation Societies (ACCS)

- 6 regional/national conservation agencies
- Local Natural History and Scientific Society
- 'Friends' of 13 green spaces
- Published **Green Croydon** map (4th reprint)

### Issues Raised by ACCS (August 2022)

- Lack of corporate insurance through Council
- Needed grants for tools
- Difficulties liaising between groups without key parks staff
- Planning groundwork when contracts expiring
- Changes in biodiversity being missed without skilled ecological supervision

### Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)

- Introduced 2010, revised 2019
- 2018-2021: Borough drew in **£33.9M**
- From Coulsdon alone: **£3.7M** from redeveloped housing
- Can be spent on play areas, parks, and open spaces

## Conclusion

Happy Valley is the largest of Croydon's open spaces at **101 ha**. The Friends have been involved in its conservation for 17 years. The Valley is now part of the **South London Downs National Nature Reserve**, which takes in the City Commons as well - some **520 ha** in total.

If the approaches and suggestions outlined in this paper are not taken up, the risk to open spaces in Croydon remains very real.
