# JUSTIFYING THE RETENTION OF CERTAIN LOCAL GREEN SPACES IN COULSDON

The official inspection of Croydon's new five year local plan demanded that a large number of very local green spaces in the borough need stronger justification if they are to be retained. (Behind this decision is pressure to find much more land in the borough on which to build dwellings "given planning constraints and development requirements".)

The Friends group intend to respond defending local green spaces in general, but it is clearly very important for local residents to write to the council about the site closest to you – what it means to you. Below is space for you to respond about a particular site:

## Response Form

**Name of the site:**

**Give your view about it:** (e.g. its character, accessibility, and how you use it).

**Give your name:** .........................................................................................

**Your address in brief:** .................................................................................

Kindly return the form by 12 July to: Ian Payne, 42 Bradmore Way, Coulsdon, CR5 1PA and the Friends will forward all the responses to the Planning Department at Croydon.

## Sites at Risk

### The list of sites thought to be chiefly at risk are listed here:

- Coulsdon Memorial Ground (Marlpit Lane)
