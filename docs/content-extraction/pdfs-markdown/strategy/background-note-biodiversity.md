# Background Note: Where Net Zero Morphs Into Net Gain

*Two wholly new challenges facing local authorities*

**Background note from the Chair for The Friends' discussion of biodiversity**
**AGM, Wednesday 8th November 2023**

---

## Historical Context

From WWII onwards, primary legislation has guided Britain's environment:
- Dozens of new towns and town expansion schemes
- New cities like Milton Keynes
- Major infrastructure: Channel Tunnel, Victoria Line, Elizabeth Line, HS1, HS2, thousands of miles of motorway

Britain's population: **48 million (1947) → 67 million (present)**

---

## The Two New Challenges

### 1. Net Zero Carbon Emissions

New laws to eliminate noxious fumes by:
- Adjusting domestic, industrial, and commercial heating
- Changing transport forms
- Planting trees and greening measures
- Target: **Net zero by 2050** (COP 20)

### 2. Net Gain in Biodiversity (Environment Act 2021)

A system of bartering where:
- Loss of biodiversity in one area through development
- Is compensated by systematic improvement elsewhere
- Developers can buy credits from Natural England for national projects

---

## Implementation Challenges

Both approaches present **wholly novel challenges** to local government - largely unprepared.

### Support Available

- Surrey Nature Partnership (SyNP) provides specialist support
- Surrey Wildlife Trust advises 10 local planning authorities across Surrey

### Concerns

**Sally Hayns (CIEEM):**
- Less than a third of local planning authorities have 'in house' advice
- Cuts in planning services
- Staff lack support
- Biodiversity assets already not well managed

**Joe Heath (Land Trust):**
- Great majority of residential site developers find working with local authorities challenging

**Dentons solicitor:**
- BNG gain not worth the cost for small sites

**Director of Ecological Planning Research:**
- Almost insurmountable problems when site substitution crosses local authority boundaries
- System prone to abuse given financial complexity

## Surrey vs London: Polar Opposites

| Surrey | London |
|--------|--------|
| Predominantly rural | Heavily urbanized |
| Much AONB and AGLV land | Croydon particularly dense |
| Good scope for biodiversity | Limited scope |

### Between Them: South London National Nature Reserve

- Part of the North Downs
- Bought **140 years ago** by City of London
- Managed directly on site in Coulsdon
- Long-term environmental plans
- Sustaining biodiversity as main aim
- **An object lesson to both authorities!**

## Surrey's Biodiversity Opportunity Areas

**63 places identified across the County:**

| Area | Count |
|------|-------|
| Thames Basin Heaths | 7 |
| Thames Basin Lowlands | 4 |
| Thames Valley | 5 |
| North Downs | 9 |
| Wealden Greensands | 13 |
| Low Weald | 7 |
| River Valleys | 6 |

### Potential Off-site Habitat Locations

All closely adjacent to North Downs and Coulsdon:
1. Farnham through to Redhill
2. The Homesdale just east of Redhill
3. Mole floodplain immediately south of Reigate-Redhill

## Bringing BNG to Built-up London (Croydon)

- Among London's largest boroughs (geography and population)
- **127 open spaces** (parks)
- Southern half among the greenest in London
- Decade of 'intensification' - demolition and redevelopment of older suburban housing
- Large-scale 'high rise' housing around town centre

### Opportunities

While there's scope to enhance biodiversity among 127 parks, greater scope exists **west of town centre**:
- Aging commercial and industrial development around Purley Way
- Much derelict and under-used land
- Could secure 'off site BNG'
