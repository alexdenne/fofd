# Elizabeth Brooks — 1953 to 2022

We were very sad to hear that Lizzie Brooks passed away on 20th March 2022.

Lizzie set up and ran the Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley Facebook group and joined the main Friends Committee in 2018. She soon became an active member and supporter of all our activities.

Lizzie will also be remembered as an active campaigner for the Tollers Estate. She led the case for the Tollers Estate bus convincing GLA officers by her passionate arguments and her intense belief in her Estate.

Described as 'a breath of fresh air', Lizzie led many campaigns for the local environment. She was also a member of the Old Coulsdon Camera Club. She will be greatly missed by both the Friends and the Local Community.
