# Friends of Farthing Downs & Happy Valley - Membership Leaflet

## About the Friends

The Friends was formed in 2005 with the full support of the City of London who have owned and managed Farthing Downs for the benefit of the public since 1883. It is a fully constituted body and is led by a committee of volunteers who meet regularly with representatives from the City.

Farthing Downs is protected by Green Belt and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) status. Its unique chalk grassland provides a home for wild flowers, including the rare Greater Yellow Rattle and rare orchids, and increasingly threatened species of birds and insects. Its open space and free access provides leisure facilities for local residents and visitors alike, including woodland, open downland and views of local and distant landmarks from the many footpaths and bridleways. Signposted walks include the London Loop, Downland Circular Walk and the Farthing Downs and Happy Valley Nature Trail.

Farthing Downs is a Scheduled Ancient Monument with distinctive Celtic field systems, Saxon burial tumuli, Neolithic trackways and WWII anti-aircraft trenches.
