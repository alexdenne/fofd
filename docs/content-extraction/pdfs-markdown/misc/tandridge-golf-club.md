# Surrey National Golf Club - HELAA Assessment Report

## Technical assessments for the Local Plan
### Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) Report 2015
**Appendix 3 – Deliverable and Developable Sites (Map – Appendix 1)**

### Site Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **HELAA Reference Number** | CAT 039 |
| **Address** | Surrey National Golf Club |
| **Site Size** | 71.74 hectares |
| **Approximate Developable Area** | 71.74 hectares |
| **Estimated Site Yield** | 1076 |
| **Green Belt** | Within Green Belt |

### Suitability

The site is a large golf course of approximately 71.7 hectares, and includes parking, a club house, and events venue. It is situated adjacent to the urban area of Caterham, with some services within a short walking distance for most parts of the site. The site is predominantly open fields that form the golf course, with areas of woodland and some ponds. A number of public right of ways run through the site. Some of the woodland in the east of the site is Ancient Woodland, and a proportion of the site also includes a PSNCI. The site's topography is varied, in part due to the landscaping associated with the golf course. A central access road forms the link from the club house and other buildings onto Rook Lane. The sites topography varies considerable with some small valleys and hills compromising the different parts of the gold course. This could affect development potential but would not prevent it. The area designated Ancient Woodland would not be considered suitable. However, the remaining areas are considered suitable in principle for development, although as the site is designated Green Belt, this would have to change in order for it to be developed.

### Available

The site has been submitted by the owners, so is considered to be available.

### Achievable

Development of the site is considered to be achievable.
