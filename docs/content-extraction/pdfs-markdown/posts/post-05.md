# Chalk Grassland

## Geological Foundation

Farthing Downs, like the whole of the North Downs, is composed of chalk. This is a fine white limestone, made mostly from the broken fragments of 'coccospheres'. These are the skeletons of microscopic plants, which were laid down between 70 and 100 million years ago, when the whole of the London area was submerged beneath the sea.

The geological cross-section of the local landscape running from north to south shows how the chalk fits into the overall geology of the area. The diagram illustrates the thickness and age of the different rock types, including:
- London Clay (400' thick)
- Woolwich Beds (65')
- Thanet Sand
- Upper Chalk (550' thick, 70 million years old)
- Middle Chalk (200')
- Lower Chalk (150')
- Upper Greensand (60')
- Gault Clay (340')
- Folkestone Sands (250')
- Sandgate Beds (70')
- Hythe Beds (250')
- Atherfield Clay (40')
- Weald Clay (700')
- Extending back to 130 million years

## Chalk Properties and Plant Adaptations

Chalk is a permeable rock which means that rainwater can pass through it. In the summer when there is less rainfall, the surface becomes very dry, and plants must be able to withstand drought conditions. Many of the plants found on the Downs are specialists, being tolerant of dry, chalky soil conditions and of being repeatedly grazed by livestock.

On the gentler slopes, however, where little of the soil has been lost by soil-creep, the effects of the alkaline chalk are minimised and more generalist plants thrive.

Thus the vegetation of Farthing Downs includes not only plants which are specific to chalk grassland, but also species which will grow on a wide range of soil types.

## Notable Plant Species

The post features several characteristic chalk grassland plants:

- **Field scabious** - A distinctive purple-blue flowering plant
- **Greater yellow rattle** - A yellow-flowered semi-parasitic plant
- **Round-headed rampion** - A striking purple flower with distinctive curved petals

## Conservation History

Just over 100 hectares of land were bought by the local authority for its preservation. New Hill was earmarked for housing although it still belonged to a property developer until 2002. During the intervening years, the land had been used for agriculture, horse grazing and eventually fallen into neglect.

Over the past 30-40 years young trees and scrub have colonised, leading to the loss of many of the open grassy areas. The grassland that has survived is very rich in places, with 8 species of orchid and other rarities being recorded.

## Trail Navigation

Continue straight ahead along the same grassy path (Do not take the path which runs uphill to the right) and cross over the bridleway. You will see post 6 on the slope of a diagonal path heading uphill (see map below).
