# Post 25: THE LARCHES

The larch is the only common conifer in this country to lose its needles in winter. It is one of our most valuable timber trees. Being waterproof and durable, the timber is used for boat building, cladding buildings and for fencing. Its deciduous character makes it a tree of great beauty in autumn and spring.

## Wildlife Features

The nest box on the left of these two larches was put up to attract hole-nesting birds such as woodpeckers.

On the same tree you can see the remains of a sign asking visitors not to pick the bluebells. Several similar signs can be seen in these woods. These were installed over 20 years ago and were originally set at about 2m high, but have gradually risen to four or five metres above the ground as the trees have grown!
