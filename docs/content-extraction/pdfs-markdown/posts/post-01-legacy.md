# Post 1: Welcome to the Happy Valley and Farthing Downs Nature Trail

## Introduction

Discover the fascinating wildlife and history of this beautiful area of countryside with our interactive walk.

The trail can be walked in one go or as two sections. The Farthing Downs section (posts 1 to 10) is reasonably flat and takes roughly 1½ hours. The Happy Valley section (posts 11 to 29) includes some steep hills and steps and takes roughly 2 hours to walk.

## How to follow the trail:

1. The route is shown by red discs mounted on wooden posts.

2. At each numbered post, tap on the appropriate number on the nature trail home page to discover the features at each location.

3. Using the back arrow on your phone or browser should return you to the nature trail home page at each stop. Alternatively you can scan the QR code at each post to return to the home page.

4. To help you follow the trail, a map and directions are given below the text for each post.

## GPS Navigation

You can also follow the trail using your smartphone's GPS, by using one of two free apps: Viewranger or TiCL.

## Wildlife spotter game

You may like to try to spot some of the wildlife shown in this guide. You score points for each plant or animal seen and add up your score at the end of the trail. Rarer plants & animals score more points.

## Getting Started

### To walk the Farthing Downs section

Go along the top of the Downs towards the wooden fence, keeping the road to your right. On your way you will pass visitor information boards which give details of the history and wildlife of Farthing Downs and the surrounding area. Post 2 is next to the gate near to the cattle grid.
