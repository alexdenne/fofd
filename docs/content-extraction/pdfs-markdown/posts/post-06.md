# Post 6: Ant Hills

## Introduction

Looking at the ground on either side of the path as you head towards post 7 you will see many small mounds within the rough grassland. These are the homes of the yellow meadow ant and are distinctive of grazed downland. These ant hills can last for many years, because the ants continually add to their structure, packing the earth firmly down.

## Structure of an Ant Hill

### A cross-section through an ant hill

1. **The queen** produces eggs which are collected by workers and stored in chambers (2).

2. **The larvae (3) and pupae (4)** are moved around the nest according to the outside temperature and moisture.

3. **Foraging ant (5)** returning with prey which will be deposited in the food store (6) until required.

4. **The ant deposits its dead** in a cemetery chamber (7).

## Characteristics and Ecology

This species constructs its nest below ground level in the early stages but later extends it into a mound of waste material above. This mound has a larger surface area than the flat ground and so warms up more quickly and can be as much as 10°C higher than the surrounding air. This is a good place to look for grasshoppers or the common lizard, as they like to rest on the dry, warm surface. The mounds are elongated and up to roughly 30cm high, with one flatter side facing east to catch the early morning sunshine.

Livestock grazing creates the optimum conditions for the ant hills to survive; notice that there are none on the mown paths.

## Ecological Importance

The yellow meadow ant, along with the earthworm, is very important in maintaining porous soil conditions.

The green woodpecker is frequently seen on the Downs and often feeds on the ground, particularly on ants. Some of the ant hills have also been plundered by badgers in search of ant eggs.

## Directions

**Continue up this diagonal path, crossing over a mown path by a bench, to reach post 7 (see map below).**

## Additional Context (from Map Section)

Just over 100 hectares of land were bought by the local authority for its preservation. New Hill was earmarked for housing although it still belonged to a property developer until 2002. During the intervening years, the land had been used for agriculture, horse grazing and eventually fallen into neglect. Over the past 30-40 years young trees and scrub have colonised, leading to the loss of many of the open grassy areas. The grassland that has survived is very rich in places, with 8 species of orchid and other rarities being recorded.

This document is part of the Farthing Downs nature trail series, describing Post 6 which focuses on the yellow meadow ant colonies found in the grazed downland habitat. The PDF includes a photograph of ant hill mounds in the grassland, an illustration of a yellow meadow ant, a detailed cross-section diagram of an ant hill's internal structure, and a nature trail map showing the location of Post 6 in relation to other posts on the trail.
