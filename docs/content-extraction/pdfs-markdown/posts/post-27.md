## BEECH TREES

In this area some magnificent beech trees are growing. Fallen beech leaves take years to rot down and are held together by a fungus which prevents the growth of other seedlings. This, together with the shade that they cast, explains the absence of shrub and plant cover beneath them. Beech like to grow on well-drained chalk soils. Their shallow roots allow them to survive on the thin soils, but make them prone to being blown over in high winds.

## Historical Importance

At one time, beech trees, like oak trees, played an important part in the economy of the village because pigs could survive the winter by eating the seeds or 'beechmast' and acorns, so providing fresh meat all the year round.

## Wildlife Spotting Activity

Look out for the insects and other small creatures that live among the leaves and other debris on the woodland floor. See how many you can spot.

**Description:** This is Post 27 of the Happy Valley and Farthing Downs Nature Trail, focusing on beech trees and their ecological characteristics. The post explains why beech trees create sparse undergrowth through fungal decomposition and heavy shade, their historical importance to village economy through beechmast production for pig farming, and includes an interactive wildlife spotting game featuring woodland floor creatures. The PDF also includes an illustration from a medieval manuscript showing people knocking down beech nuts, plus photographs of beech trees and various insects/arthropods found on the woodland floor.
