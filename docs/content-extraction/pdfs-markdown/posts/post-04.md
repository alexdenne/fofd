## HEDGEROW & CLIMBING PLANTS

Continue down the path into the trees and turn right. Count the number of different trees and shrubs you can see in the first thirty metres of this hedge.

Dr. Max Hooper of the old Nature Conservancy Council suggested that the age of a hedge can be found by counting the number of species, the idea being that older hedges are colonised by more species over time. If you find one species then the hedge is likely to be about one hundred years old; if there are four it is probably Tudor in age, and if there are nine to twelve species it existed in Saxon times.

**How many species did you find?**

'Hooper's rule', as it is known, is only an approximate rule of thumb and doesn't apply to recently planted hedges, but it can be a useful way to identify and age historically important hedgerows.

You may notice a number of climbing plants in this stretch of hedgerow.

**How many can you spot?**

### White bryony

Dull green deeply-lobed leaves, pale green flowers from May to September. Stems have spirally-coiled tendrils which the plant uses to climb. The fruit is a matt crimson berry 5-8mm across.

*15 points*

### Old man's beard

Also known as 'traveller's joy', this woody climber is a wild clematis. It has peeling fibrous bark and can form thick vine-like stems. The flowers are greenish cream and have four petal-like sepals. Seeds form fluffy plumes in the autumn.

*5 points*

### Black bryony

Unrelated to white bryony, this climber has long, heart-shaped, glossy leaves. Flowers are bell-shaped and yellow-green from May-July. Fruits are round scarlet berries, clustered along the stem. These are poisonous, so do not touch!

*10 points*

## Navigation to Post 5

Continue following the footpath through the trees to the corner and turn uphill until you eventually emerge into the open. Cross over the horse ride onto a wide grassy path, turn left and walk along for approximately 140 metres until you see post 5 on the right (see map below).

## Historical Context

Just over 100 hectares of land were bought by the local authority for its preservation. New Hill was earmarked for housing although it still belonged to a property developer until 2002. During the intervening years, the land had been used for agriculture, horse grazing and eventually fallen into neglect. Over the past 30-40 years young trees and scrub have colonised, leading to the loss of many of the open grassy areas. The grassland that has survived is very rich in places, with 8 species of orchid and other rarities being recorded.

## Map Note

The PDF includes a Nature Trail Map showing Farthing Downs and New Hill, with Post 4 through Post 5 marked on the trail route. The map indicates the Farthing Downs car park and toilets, and shows the start of both the Farthing Downs trail and the Happy Valley trail.

This document is part of a series of nature trail posts covering the Farthing Downs and Happy Valley area. The post focuses on hedgerow ecology and climbing plant identification, incorporating both educational content about Hooper's rule for dating hedges and practical field identification of three common climbing plant species (white bryony, old man's beard/traveller's joy, and black bryony).
