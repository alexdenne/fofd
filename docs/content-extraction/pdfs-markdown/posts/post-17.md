## HORSE CHESTNUT TREE

The large tree to the right of the path is a horse chestnut. It is not native to Britain and was first recorded growing here in the l7th Century.

Its name was derived from the fact that the Turks, who lived in the Balkans where it grew, were reputed to have made a drug from the conkers to cure breathing difficulties in horses. Coincidentally when the leaves fall in the autumn, they leave a horse shoe-shaped scar where the leaf stalk was attached to the branch.

The leaves are 'palmate', like fingers of a hand, but each leaflet is 'pinnate' like a herring bone.

In the USA, horse chestnuts are called 'buckeye' as the nuts are thought to resemble the eye of a deer. The game of conkers is believed to either come from the word 'conquerer' or 'conch', as it was once played with snail shells.

The wood is light, easily carved and absorbant, and at one time was used to make artificial limbs.

Bear left out of the woods, cross the bottom of the valley and go through the gap in the hedge, taking care as you cross the horse ride. Walk up the hill to post 18 (see map below).
