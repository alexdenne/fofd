# Post 8: THE FOLLY & THE MILLENNIUM CAIRN

## The Folly

The name 'the Folly' was used on a map dating from 1783, and referred to a clump of seven trees. Only one of the original trees remains today, although several replacements have since been planted. The absence of trees on top of the Downs is largely because of its exposed position. Even these beech trees show the effect of the prevailing south-westerly winds by having their upper twigs growing away from the wind.

## Wildlife in Happy Valley

A pair of kestrels often nests in Happy Valley and can sometimes be seen hovering over this point on the Downs. In the summer months you may hear the song of the skylark. So high up in the sky as to be sometimes invisible to the naked eye, the skylark proclaims its territory by a very long, liquid note or "chirrup". The skylark is one of the few inland birds that makes its nest in rough grassland. Please keep dogs under control to avoid disturbing these increasingly rare birds.

## The Millennium Cairn

Continue walking along the wide grassy path and you will soon see a well trodden path on the left leading to a flint cairn. From the cairn and you can admire the views all around you. Looking north it is often possible to see the City of London on the horizon.

The cairn was constructed by volunteers during September 2000, and beneath it lies a time capsule containing items relevant to that year. Included in the contents of the container are microfilmed documents, photographs and a selection of objects relating to Coulsdon. Hopefully these items will survive for future historians to uncover in many years to come.

## Walking Directions

Leave the cairn by following the path towards the road, follow the path on the right for approximately 150 metres until a junction with a diagonal path from the right. Cross over the road and continue down a diagonal path until you see post 9 (see map below).

## Land Preservation

Just over 100 hectares of land were bought by the local authority for its preservation. New Hill was earmarked for housing although it still belonged to a property developer until 2002. During the intervening years, the land had been used for agriculture, horse grazing and eventually fallen into neglect. Over the past 30-40 years young trees and scrub have colonised, leading to the loss of many of the open grassy areas. The grassland that has survived is very rich in places, with 8 species of orchid and other rarities being recorded.
