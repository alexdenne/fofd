## MIDLAND HAWTHORN & ROSEBAY WILLOWHERB

To the right of the path is a tree called Midland hawthorn. Some trees within a woodland indicate that it is very old or 'ancient woodland'. Midland hawthorn is one such tree, and is seldom found outside of ancient woodland. It can be told from common hawthorn because the leaves are less deeply lobed. The scarlet berries or 'haws' are also distinctive in the autumn. The berries of common hawthorn have only one seed, whereas those of Midland hawthorn have two or even three.

In this part of the woods you may also come across patches of rosebay willowherb. This tall plant has pink flowers from July to September. In the past, when the woods were coppiced in this area, the brushwood was stacked and burnt at various spots. These fire sites can still be located because they were colonised by rosebay willowherb, which is a plant associated with burnt ground and was characteristic of bomb sites after the war. In the United States the plant colonised vast areas of woodland devastated by forest fires and so gained the name "fireweed".

**Description:** This is Post 26 of the Happy Valley and Farthing Downs Nature Trail, focusing on two distinctive plants: Midland hawthorn and rosebay willowherb. The post explains how Midland hawthorn serves as an indicator of ancient woodland and describes its distinguishing features from common hawthorn. It also details the presence of rosebay willowherb at historical fire sites from past coppicing activities, connecting the plant to both wartime bomb sites and its American nickname "fireweed". The location is in the Devilsden Woods section of the trail.
