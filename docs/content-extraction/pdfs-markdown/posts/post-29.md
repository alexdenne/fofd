# Post 29

## Congratulations!

### You have completed the nature trail

We hope that you enjoyed this walk.

If you were counting points for the wildlife you saw, there were a total of 385 possible. You would be very lucky to score this many in one visit. Why not try the walk again at a different time of year?

## Looking after the Downs

Happy Valley and Farthing Downs are nationally important for their wildlife and historic interest. The area is designated as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM). The sites are managed with the support of many partner organisations and volunteers:

### Partner Organizations
