# Post 2: Green Belt Land

## New Hill and Happy Valley

Facing across the road, you have a commanding view of New Hill. These 34 hectares were bought by the City of London Corporation in 2002 to preserve the area for recreation and wildlife.

Looking to the right you will see Happy Valley. In 1937 this area was described as 'one of the most beautiful valleys in the district' and just over 100 hectares of land were bought by the local authority for its preservation.

## Saved from Development

New Hill had been allocated for housing in the 1940's, but was saved from development when the area was designated as green belt land.

The area still belonged to a property developer until 2002. During the intervening years, the land had been used for agriculture and horse grazing, but had eventually fallen into neglect. Young trees and scrub colonised the fields, leading to the loss of many of the open wild flower meadows.

## Conservation and Recovery

The grassland that survived was very rich in places, with 8 species of orchid and other rarities being recorded. Some of the larger areas of scrub have since been cleared and livestock grazing has been introduced to keep an open aspect.

## Directions

Now pass through the gate and turn left down the diagonal path, looking out for a directional marker to take you to post 3 (see map below).
