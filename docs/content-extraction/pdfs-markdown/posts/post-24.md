# Post 24: Ditches Lane Pits & Iron Man

## Ditches Lane

This path is thought to run along the old line of Ditches Lane. It is not certain when the road was diverted to the west, but it was suggested by a local archaeologist that it was done to serve a house or other building on this corner.

In the woods to the right of the path are two pits whose origin is something of a mystery. The most reasonable explanation is that they were dug to extract flints for making up the road.

## The Iron Man - Coal Post

A little further on, where the path meets the present road, there is an iron boundary post, one of many erected by the City of London in 1861. The posts marked the edge of the London Metropolitan Police District, within which tax was collected on coal and wine brought into London.

The tax was originally introduced to pay for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666. It was not abolished until 1899, by which time the money was being used for general improvements to City properties.

The popular name for this post is an 'iron man'. The markings on the front refer to the Act of Parliament which gave rise to the tax, in the 24th and 25th year of the reign of Queen Victoria, chapter 42 of the Statute Book.

## Trail Navigation

Follow the track around to the right and into the woods. Post 25 is a short distance along this path (see map below).
