# Re-use and Adapt: Farthing Down Kiosk

## Overview

This architectural drawing presents a comprehensive design scheme for the reuse and adaptation of a building structure at Farthing Down Kiosk. The document showcases "sketch scheme 2" created by SALT Architects for the client LUC (Land Use Consultants).

## Architectural Design Elements

### Building Elevations

The design includes detailed architectural elevations from multiple perspectives:

**East Elevation**
- New roof profiles and parapet details
- Access to kiosk area
- Possible access to bin area
- New roof to side access

**North Elevation**
- Cut back roof extension to provide shelter and improve appearance of building
- Large fold back doors to kiosk (to be used for interpretive panels)
- Multiple window and door configurations

**South Elevation**
- Cut back roof extended to provide shelter and improve appearance of building
- Enhanced visual appeal through thoughtful roof design

### Site Plan Features

The site plan reveals the building's context within its surroundings:

- Strategic positioning of the store structure
- Existing oak tree preservation
- Carefully planned access routes for maintenance and services
- Seating areas for visitors
- Wooded surroundings with multiple mature trees indicated on the plan
- New access points for side entry areas
- Designated areas for building services

### Design Philosophy

The architectural approach emphasizes:

1. **Adaptive Reuse**: Refurbishing the existing structure rather than complete replacement
2. **Environmental Integration**: Respecting the natural setting with careful placement among existing trees
3. **Functional Enhancement**: Adding interpretive panels and improved access points
4. **Weather Protection**: Extended roof sections to provide shelter and improve building aesthetics
5. **Service Accommodation**: Thoughtful integration of necessary building services

### Technical Details

**Project Information:**
- Client: LUC
- Architect: SALT Architects, 5 Langdale Beverley, East Yorkshire HU17 8EJ
- Drawing Number: 2258
- Scale: NTS (Not To Scale)
- Drawing Status: As indicated on original document

**Design Notes:**
- All figured dimensions are to be checked on site before any work is put in hand
- The design aims to provide an attractive and sustainable building envelope for services
- Emphasis on heat gains and daylighting optimization

## Historical Significance

This project represents an important approach to heritage building conservation, demonstrating how existing structures can be thoughtfully adapted for contemporary use while respecting their historical context and natural surroundings. The design shows sensitivity to the landscape setting of Farthing Down while improving functionality and visitor experience.
