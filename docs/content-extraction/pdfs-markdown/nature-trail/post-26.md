# Post 26: Midland Hawthorn & Rosebay Willowherb

## Midland Hawthorn

To the right of the path is a tree called Midland hawthorn. Some trees within a woodland indicate that it is very old or 'ancient woodland'. Midland hawthorn is one such tree, and is seldom found outside of ancient woodland. It can be told from common hawthorn because the leaves are less deeply lobed. The scarlet berries or 'haws' are also distinctive in the autumn. The berries of common hawthorn have only one seed, whereas those of Midland hawthorn have two or even three.

## Rosebay Willowherb

In this part of the woods you may also come across patches of rosebay willowherb. This tall plant has pink flowers from July to September. In the past, when the woods were coppiced in this area, the brushwood was stacked and burnt at various spots. These fire sites can still be located because they were colonised by rosebay willowherb, which is a plant associated with burnt ground and was characteristic of bomb sites after the war. In the United States the plant colonised vast areas of woodland devastated by forest fires and so gained the name "fireweed".

## Trail Directions

Continue along the path, turn right at the fingerpost, go down the hill & the steps and turn left along the main track through Devilsden Woods (see map below).

The Midland hawthorn is presented as an indicator species of ancient woodland, distinguished from common hawthorn by its less deeply lobed leaves and berries containing 2-3 seeds instead of one. The rosebay willowherb section explains how this plant marks historical fire sites from past coppicing activities, drawing connections to its appearance on WWII bomb sites and its American name "fireweed."
