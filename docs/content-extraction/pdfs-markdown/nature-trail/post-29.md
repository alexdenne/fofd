# Post 29: Congratulations!

**You have completed the nature trail**

We hope that you enjoyed this walk.

If you were counting points for the wildlife you saw, there were a total of **385 possible**. You would be very lucky to score this many in one visit. Why not try the walk again at a different time of year?
