# Post 29: Trail Completion

## Congratulations!

You have completed the nature trail

We hope that you enjoyed this walk. If you were counting points for the wildlife you saw, there were a total of 385 possible. You would be very lucky to score this many in one visit. Why not try the walk again at a different time of year?

## Looking after the Downs

Happy Valley and Farthing Downs are nationally important for their wildlife and historic interest. The area is designated as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM). The sites are managed with the support of many partner organisations and volunteers:

- Friends of Farthing Downs
- Quadron
- Green Flag Award
- The Conservation Volunteers (TCV)
- Downlands Partnership
- Natural England
- Forestry Commission
- Historic England

## Friends of Farthing Downs

The creation and maintenance of this trail has kindly been supported by The Friends of Farthing Downs, who were formed in 2005 and aim to help protect and enhance the heritage and leisure value of the Downs, and to promote a wider awareness of the area through community events, activities and fundraising.
