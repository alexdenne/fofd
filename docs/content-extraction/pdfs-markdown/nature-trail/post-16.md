# Post 16: Wild Cherry Trees and Dead Wood Habitat

## Wild Cherry Trees

To the right of the path are several large wild cherry trees, or 'geans'. They can be recognised by their reddish bark and horizontal markings around the trunk. The height of these trees will surprise many people who think of the cherry as a small ornamental tree. Most flowering cherries, which originate from the mountains of Japan, are small but the native British cherry can grow into a large tree over forty feet in height.

In this woodland, because of the competition for light, they are particularly tall and straight.

## Dead Wood Habitat

In this part of the woods, you may come across fallen trees which have been left to rot down naturally. Such trees were once removed by foresters to keep the woodland 'tidy' and because it was feared that they would spread disease. It is now realised that dead wood is important to a whole host of wildlife, including beetles, fungi, lichens and hole-nesting birds.
