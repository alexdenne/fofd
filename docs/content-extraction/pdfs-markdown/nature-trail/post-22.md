# Post 22: Ditches Lane Pond

This pond was originally dug to provide water for livestock. At one time it almost dried out from lack of maintenance, but is now regularly cleared. In the spring and summer you may be able to see some of these water creatures from the pond's edge, but be careful not to go too close to the water!

## See how many you can spot

### Pond Creatures

**Pond skater** - These move on the water surface using their middle legs as oars and their hind legs for steering
**5 points**

**Water boatman** - These are bugs and, because they have no gills, have to surface often to collect an air bubble to breathe underwater.
**10 points**

**Water beetle** - These are carnivorous, living on tadpoles and small fish which they catch with their strong jaws
**5 points**

**Ramshorn snail** - These are common & easily recognised as their shells are coiled flat and never raised into a spire.
**5 points**

**Great pond snail** - Water snails feed mostly on algae, but the great pond snail can eat newts and sticklebacks!
**10 points**

### Spawn

Freshwater animals usually hatch from eggs, and in the spring various kinds of egg can sometimes be found. See if you can spot those shown below.

**Frog spawn** - Frogs produce masses of round eggs each with a black dot in the middle which will become a tadpole. Frogs breed from February until April, returning to the same site each year. They prefer shallow water in full sunlight.
**5 points**

**Toad spawn** - Unlike frog spawn, toad spawn is found in deeper water. The eggs are laid gradually as the female moves about entangling long strings of jelly around the water plants. Each string can be as long as 3m
**10 points**
