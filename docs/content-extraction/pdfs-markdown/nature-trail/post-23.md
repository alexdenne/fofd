# Post 23: Bluebell Shaw

This strip of woodland or 'shaw' was cleared of brambles during the 1970's to encourage bluebells and other plants to grow.

Small woodland plants such as bluebell and wood anemone can compete with taller plants because they finish flowering early in the year, before the shrubs and trees come into leaf and shade them out. However, bramble is a semi-evergreen and can smother smaller plants.

Due to overpicking and trampling in the past, bluebells are now given special legal protection.

## Bracken

You may notice large patches of bracken in this area. Bracken is one of the oldest ferns, with fossil records over 55 million years old having been found.

It was once used as animal bedding, in soap and glass making and as a fertiliser. In the autumn the fronds turn a glorious gold colour.
