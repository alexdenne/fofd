## WELCOME TO THE HAPPY VALLEY AND FARTHING DOWNS NATURE TRAIL

Discover the fascinating wildlife and history of this beautiful area of countryside with our interactive walk

The trail can be walked in one go or as two sections. The Farthing Downs section (posts 1 to 10) is reasonably flat and takes roughly 1½ hours. The Happy Valley section (posts 11 to 29) includes some steep hills and steps and takes roughly 2 hours to walk.

## How to follow the trail:

1. The route is shown by red discs mounted on wooden posts.

2. At each numbered post, tap on the appropriate number on the nature trail home page to discover the features at each location.

3. Using the the back arrow on your phone or browser should return you to the nature trail home page at each stop. Alternatively you can scan the QR code at each post to return to the home page.

4. To help you follow the trail, a map and directions are given below the text for each post.

You can also follow the trail using your smartphone's GPS, by using one of two free apps: Viewranger or TiCL.

## Wildlife spotter game
