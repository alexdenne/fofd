Some, like the </SPAN><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN" lang=EN>Chinese Water Deer, were first introduced into Britain in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> and early 20<SUP>th</SUP> Centuries, however, this breed of deer has a strong preference for tall reed and grass areas in rich alluvial deltas and is unlikely to be seen around here. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Likewise, the Sika Deer was introduced from Japan in the 1880s and the Muntjac from China in the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Sika is most widespread in Scotland but the Muntjac is widespread across England and Wales with increasing feral populations probably helped by deliberate movement and release by humans. These three breeds were brought back by explorers and originally kept in parks and Zoos. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The introduction of the Fallow Deer was much earlier possibly either by the Norman French or the Romans, who may brought them along for a tasty snack.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Fallow Deer is considered native to this country along with the Red Deer and the Roe (our most ancient deer) which has inhabited Britain since before the Mesolithic period (6000 to 10000 years BC).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Due to forest clearance and overhunting the Roe became extinct by the 19<SUP>th</SUP> Century but was reintroduced by the Victorians.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They are now thriving once more due to recent re-planting of woodland and forests.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN" lang=EN><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Neil explained the inbuilt survival characteristics of the deer.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>For example, the Roe deer mate in August but implantation of the egg is delayed until January to avoid the harsh winters. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The Muntjac has no specific breeding season and produces all year round; they begin breeding at eight months old, have a gestation period of seven months and are able to mate again within days of giving birth. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>As we know, male deer fight for supremacy over the heard of females, usually the older stronger male winning out over younger ones. Culling in deer parks, such as Richmond helps to keep the heard healthy and sustainable but this has to be carried out with care as if a master buck is taken out too early then there is always the possibility that the younger males will be too well matched and may be injure or kill each other leaving <SPAN style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt">a weakened heard.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Neil showed us examples of antlers, grown by the males for the mating season, and we were able to examine these closely.</SPAN><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt">The largest, from the Red deer, was extremely heavy. The Roe deer are the only breed which has palmate antlers which again were surprisingly</SPAN> heavy  none of us would have liked to walk around with these on our heads, however, the antlers are shed once the rutting season is over. <o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

Being selective feeders, Roe deer can create niches for a variety of wildlife.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The local deer population is low and deer roaming the Downs belong to a wider population covering all the local open space and there has been very little damage to habitats found on the Commons.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Neil invited local residents with concerns about deer to contact him for further advice.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
